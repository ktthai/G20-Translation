118	\n<npcportrait name='tarlach_young'/><title name='Tarlach'/>\nRuairi, we definitely need to look into this place further.<br/>\nSpiders like these are not usually found in Erinn.

271	\n<title name='Cichol'/>\nAh... You finally figured it out, Mores?<br/>\n<p/>\n<title name='Cichol'/>\nHow stupid humans are, so easily deceived by what their eyes see...<br/>\nEven a great wizard like you is no exception to that...<br/>\n<p/>\n<title name='Cichol'/>\nYou didn't trust me enough to fully resurrect Glas Ghaibhleann, <br/>\nleaving it weak and vulnerable.<br/>\nYet it took you this long to find the courage to disclose my true identity?<p/>\n\n<npcportrait name='mores'/><title name='Mores'/>\nCichol, I knew it was you.<br/>\nHow dare you disguise yourself as the Goddess...<br/>\n<p/>\n
272	\n<title name='Mores'/>I knew it from the moment you tried to kill Tarlach and Mari...<br/>\n<p/>\n<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHa ha...

300	\n\n<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nYes...

364	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='gloom'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nPl... please don't get mad...<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>...I, I was just...<br/>worried about you...<br/>...I thought you should eat something...<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>....
365	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I'm human and you're a Fomor!<br/>Don't try to get too close to me.
366	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='sulky'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n......I... I see...<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>...
367	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='gloom'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nI'm sorry... to bother you...
368	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>... A friend told me this once.<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nHumans and Fomors...<br/>Although they can show kindness to one another,<br/>it is impossible for them to see eye to eye.
369	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n...Do... do you...<br/>believe that...<br/>st...story as well...?
370	<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='tear'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nI just... wanted to help you... <br/>that's all...
371	<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='thinking2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...<p/><p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Don't try to get too close to me.<br/>As soon as I thank Morgant,<br/>I have no other business here.
372	<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='sulky'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n...<br/>Do you hate me... because I'm a Fomor...?<p/><p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>\n...<p/><p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>\nBut... Fomors hate me too...<br/>Humans hate me as well...<br/>I don't know where I belong...
373	<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='tear'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nI just thought you would<br/>understand and appreciate this...<br/>I didn't think you would hate me like others would...<br/>I... really put a lot of effort into taking care of you... <p/><p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>\nBut... But...
374	<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...<p/><p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Whatever.
375	<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi... Morgant is here.
376	<title name='Morgant'/>\nTriona, you stay outside.
377	<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nYou... You...!<br/>Ahh! I'm going to kill you!!!!
378	<title name='Morgant'/>\n... Enough! Ruairi!!!!<br/>Don't give me the ultimate disgrace of<br/>fighting a human who can't even take care of himself right now.<p/><p/><title name='Morgant'/>\nIf you really want, we can fight later!<br/>But now is not the time!
379	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... You! Morrighan's puppet!<br/>... What do you want from me!<br/>Why did you keep me alive!!!
380	<title name='Morgant'/>... I like your attitude.<br/>I like how you get straight to the point.
381	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n......Then stop beating around the bush!<br/>Why did you save me!!
382	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n.........Let's just say that there was something different about you from other humans,<br/>and that interested me.<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...How you tried to <br/>forfeit your life at the last moment to save the young girl.<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Though you could've been the Lord of the area if you wanted to,<br/>you gave it to your younger brother<br/>and chose the life of a warrior instead...
383	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nWhat, you've been doing<br/>background checks on me...?<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...I don't know what to make of that.
384	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nSince you seem to be so considerate of me, why don't we change the subject...?<br/>How about...the people around you?<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Did you know your brother became the Lord...?
385	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>  <face name='thinking2'/>  \n...I see... Is that right...?<br/>It's been a long time... That doesn't surprise me.<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Wait, my father...!! <br/>Did...my father pass away...?
386	<npcportrait name=' ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Humans can't live forever... <p/><npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Humans can't help but destroy each other and bring themselves down...
387	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!<br/>...What do you mean by that?
388	<title name='Morgant'/>\n... Ruairi...<br/>... Your father was murdered.<br/>That's how Rian was chosen to become the new Lord.
389	<title name='Ruairi'/>  <face name='rage'/>  \nWhat? Who did it...!!
390	<title name='Morgant'/>\nIt was Esras.<br/>The prime minister of Emain Macha, Esras the Druid.
391	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>   <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n<title name='Ruairi'/>\nWh..what?<br/>There's no way...<br/>...That can't be!<br/>Esras is not like that!
392	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nYou misjudged her... It happens all the time.<br/><p/><npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nEven if you were right about her before,<br/>humans... always seem to change.<br/>You should know.<p/><npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Esras currently holds all of Emain Macha in her hand.<br/>Rian is simply her puppet<br/>to controll as she pleases.
393	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='bad'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... What, how could this be...?
394	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nThe more power the humans get a hold of, the more they want.<br/>...Face it. That's why there's a term called human nature.<p/><npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nEsras is no exception.
395	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='thinking'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nNo.... It... can't be...
396	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nYou're in denial....<br/>That's the reason why I think highly of you, but...<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI think I told you too much for one day.<br/>...If you've already given up the Lordship, then don't dwell on it.<br/>Esras wouldn't want that either.
397	<title name='Ruairi'/>\nShut up!
398	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nI can't believe you just said that!
399	<title name='Morgant'/>\nI applaud your courage,<br/>but, I can tell that your body has grown very weak.<p/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... Rest for now. I'll be back later.
400	<title name='Morgant'/>\nIf you try to<br/>... leave this place...<p/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... I can't guarantee your safety.
401	Hey... are you leaving...?\nYou're not... coming back anymore...?
402	... Are you awake...?
403	Don't go... I don't care if I don't become the Lord...\nJust... Just....
404	Haha...\nIt is the father's wish for you to become the Lord.\nBesides, I'm not really interested in that kind of stuff.
405	... But... But...\nYou're on my side...
406	I know...
407	But it's better that I'm not here.\n... You wouldn't understand right now even if I explain it to you.
408	...
409	Rian. You're destined to someday become the Lord.\nHow will you become a powerful Lord if you cry over something like this...?\nAnd... You have Esras... It'll be okay.
410	... Ruairi...
411	Rian... I'll promise you.\nIf something ever happens to you\nI will be there to help you...\nNo matter... how far I might be... I promise I'll come back...
412	... I will protect you...
413	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi! Where are you going?
414	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='thinking'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I appreciate everything you did for me...
415	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nI... I want to go with you! <br/>You can't go alone...<br/>Plus... You don't even know the way back...
416	<title name='Ruairi'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  \nNo, you can't! I can barely take care of myself right now!<br/>... Didn't you hear what Morgant said?<br/>The same goes true for you! I can't guarantee that I'll be able to save your life!
417	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='gloom'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi....
418	<npcportrait name='triona'/>   <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi!!!
419	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I think we're almost there. Go back now.
420	<npcportrait name='triona'/><title name='Triona'/>\n...<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='gloom'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi...<br/>... Will I ever see you again...?
421	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...<br/> I don't understand why you want to be so close to me...<br/>...I'm not the kind of person... who you think I am.<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Go back to Morgant. <p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='thinking2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Thank you for everything.
422	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='sulky'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n...Ruairi... <p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='sulky'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n...<p/><npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='tear'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n...Then...
423	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='thinking2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I'm sorry.
424	<npcportrait name='nruairi'/><title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\nIt's a Fomor! Kill her!!
425	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\n... Ah... I don't want to fight....!<br/>I'll just go home quietly... Please let me go...!
426	<npcportrait name='ntriona'/><title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\n... I thought Fomors only come out from Barri dungeon...<br/>You can beg all you want, it doesn't matter!
427	Ahh!!
428	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nTriona....
429	<title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\nSo... it is really a Fomor...<br/>Let's take her alive to the castle.
430	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nTriona!!!
431	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Hey!! What are you guys trying to do?
432	<title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\nGasp!! Oh my gosh... it's... it's...<br/>It's the Lord's Doppelganger...!!!
433	<title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\n... I can't tell the difference...
434	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... What...?<br/>I'm a Doppelganger...?
435	<title name='Paladin Trainee'/>\n... But we are the proud Knights of Light! <br/>Fomors do not scare us!!
436	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...I will show you mercy<br/>and spare your lives.<p/><npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Go home now.
437	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nRian!!!
438	<npcportrait name='rewan'/><title name='Rian'/>\n...
439	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nRian! It's me! Your brother Ruairi!<br/>... You don't recognize me...?
440	<npcportrait name='rewan'/><title name='Rian'/>\n...Esras...
441	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... What is going on here!<br/>Why are you leaving this Fomor alone?!
442	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nEsras!!<br/>What are you doing!
443	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...!<p/><npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... Just as I assumed, a Doppelganger...
444	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... W... What....?<br/>Esras!!!<br/>How could you not recognize me!<br/>It's me! Ruairi!
445	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... A Fomor trying to act as if he's human.<br/>Kill him!
446	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nEsras!<br/>This is one big misunderstanding.<br/>Please have your guards retreat!
447	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nI don't want to hear<br/>your cunning lies Fomor!
448	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nDoppelganger...<br/>If you take another step, this child is dead.
449	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I do not wish to fight anymore either.<br/>You can investigate me if you want.<br/>Please let her go. That girl has nothing to do with this.
450	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nDoppelganger...<br/>... Is that right...? Then get on your knees and surrender!<br/>If not...!!
451	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Triona!!
452	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nI'll do as you say!!.<br/>... Please let Triona go!
453	<npcportrait name='triona'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Triona'/>\nRu... Ruairi!
454	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nWise decision for a Fomor, I say. I'm impressed.<br/>Now, hurry up and kill this Doppelganger!
455	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!
456	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nTriona!!!
457	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Ahh... You... You are....
458	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nKill this Fomor!
459	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nHow... how could you...!!!<br/>Esras!!!!<br/>How dare you!!!
460	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nKill this Fomor!
461	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nMorgant!
462	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI will ask you later...<br/>... why you didn't listen to me.
463	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nRuairi... This is what human justice is all about.<br/>I'm sure you saw Esras' true nature by now.<br/>... Do you need to see anything else?
464	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nAlright, now let's go back with Triona.<br/>You will have your chance to fight them later.<br/>I will give you more than enough strength when the time is right.
465	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... The choice is yours.
466	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nWhat are you doing, hurry up and catch them! Hurry!<br/>The Lord will give a handsome reward to the one who catches them first!
467	<npcportrait name='craig'/><title name='Craig'/>\nAre you really... quitting the training...?
468	<npcportrait name='craig'/><title name='Craig'/>\nIs it because of what happened...?<br/>... I'm sure you carefully thought through it...
469	<npcportrait name='craig'/><title name='Craig'/>\n... Then I won't ask you any further.<br/>It's understandable that you could be traumatized by an experience like that. I understand.
470	<username/>... can you hear me...?\nAre you looking for the path... The path of the Knight of Light...?
471	...There's no time...\nI can't stop the power of Cichol all by myself... \nBut Morgant... I can tell his power is continually growing...
472	<username/>... do not be discouraged and continue to find the path...\nThe path of the Knight of Light is still in Emain Macha...\nLugh... Find Lugh, the Knight of Light...
473	Don't forget.\nYou'll need much perseverance and sacrifice\nto walk the path of becoming the Knight of Light...
474	Your desire to follow after Lugh, the Knight of Light\nwill lead you to become a Knight of Light...
475	Hang in there... I believe in you...
476	<npcportrait name='darklord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nDo you remember... Ruairi?<br/>How you wanted to become a Paladin in the past...?
477	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...
478	<npcportrait name='darklord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nEven back then, you said there was something<br/>about the group Paladin Knights that you could not be convinced of...
479	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...You even know about that...?
480	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...I can't say I know everything...<br/>But I know most of your past.
481	What, you're quitting already?
482	What I want is not a bunch of talk\nabout justice and power!
483	Hmph. Ruairi, you're stupid.\nYou were so determined before, but now you want to quit just because you don't like it...
484	Forget it.\nIt'll be a waste of time for me to even try to explain.
485	<npcportrait name='dart_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...In the end, the terms humans constantly refer to, righteousness and justice,<br/>are created solely by human standards...<p/><title name='Morgant'/>\nWhat humans consider truth or goodness are <br/>simply standards that were set by those who first explained them.
486	<npcportrait name='dart_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...That's not only selfish,<br/>but irresponsible, don't you think?
487	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...What are you trying to say...?
488	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nYou should already know this.<br/>It is dangerous for a human being<br/>to have more power than one can handle.
489	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...It not only brings tragedy upon that person,<br/>but to the people around the person as well.
490	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nEven so, things like that happen often, and are considered to be the norm.
491	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...You are even aware of the internal struggle I went through...?
492	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n.....It means that<br/>Triona is not the only victim of such a thing.
493	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Bu, but, I thought the Fomors want to exterminate humans?<br/>Aren't you... the same!?
494	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... That's a myth humans believe in without hesitation.
495	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nWhat I'm interested in is<br/>connecting Erinn and the world outside of Erinn...<br/>That way, I can show the humans how idiotic it is for them to believe that the universe revolves around them.
496	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Even if you say in that way,<br/>there is no difference between your definition of justice and justice for humans!<br/>Justice for humans and justice for Fomors are one and the same!!!
497	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n Then who will be responsible for the aftermath after the inevitable collision between the two?<br/>Don't try to persuade me with you Fomor's ideology. <br/>Did you forget that I'm human?
498	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nWe do not fulfill our greed by manipulating the standards of justice.<br/>The duty of a Dark Knight is that<br/>we train ourselves by using the wisdom that the creator gave us,<br/>and stop humans' arrogance and tyranny. That is the duty of Dark Knights.<br/>...Ruairi. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?
499	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n It is a sin to confuse your stupidity as a voice of reason.
500	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n....
501	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nAnd one more thing.<br/>... I'm not a Fomor... I'm human.<br/>Just like you.
502	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n A human? ... Like me?
503	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n Yes...<br/>I'm a human who desires to destroy every irrational idea...
504	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... and wants everything to reset and start from scratch, fair and square.
505	<npcportrait name='redire'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nStop!!
506	<npcportrait name='rewan_alive'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Rian'/>\n...Redire!<br/>What took you so long!!
507	<npcportrait name='nredire'/>  <face name='serious'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n Sorry, my lord.<br/>Blast me later if you must, but<br/>... for now, please move behind me!!
508	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n So... you must be Redire...?
509	<npcportrait name='redire'/><title name='Redire'/>\nAre... aren't you Dark Lord...?<br/> How did you end up in here...?<p/><npcportrait name='redire'/><title name='Redire'/>\n Why did you attack the town of Emain Macha!!!<br/>Why did you kill those innocent people?!!
510	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n I am here to take back what you have removed from me.<br/>My daughter....
511	<npcportrait name='redire'/>  <face name='serious'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nWhat? I have no idea what you're talking about!
512	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI thought Paladins were a symbol of nobility and honesty...<br/>but I guess that only applies among humans...<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... It seems that Paladins have no problem lying to Fomors.
513	<npcportrait name='redire'/><title name='Redire'/>\n In the name of all Paladins,<br/>we, in no way shape or form, jeopardize our honor by lying!
514	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n Don't you remember invading Math Dungeon? <br/>You killed my men and even took my baby, don't you remember?
515	<npcportrait name='redire'/>  <face name='serious'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n!!!
516	<npcportrait name='nredire'/>  <face name='serious'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nThe baby at Math Dungeon....<p/><npcportrait name='nredire'/>  <face name='serious'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... that baby... was a Fomor?
517	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nDo not even try to tell me you didn't know...<br/>Why don't you tell me this instead. <br/>Your definition of justice for Paladins include killing other lives and abducting a baby.
518	<npcportrait name='nredire'/><title name='Redire'/>\nN... no! That's not it!<br/>There was a misunderstanding!!
519	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n Well then...<br/>I would like to hear your response not with words, but with your sword!!!!
520	<npcportrait name='rewan_alive'/>  <face name='attacked'/>  <title name='Rian'/>\n ARRRGGGHHH!!!
521	<npcportrait name='redire'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n No!!!! My lord!!!
522	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n Do you honestly believe that everything you've done was the right thing to do?<br/>If you aren't sure of things you did, <br/>then you will not have the strength to defend it, either.
523	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n Dark Lord,<br/>here's your child.<p/><npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n Let's end this fight and forget about this.<br/>Leave this town immediately. Now!!
524	<title name='Morgant'/>\n...<p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n Good... <br/>... as long as I find my Triona,<br/>I have no business with you. <p/><npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nLet's go!!
525	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...Arrest that Paladin.<p/><npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nHe's the one that provided the cause for this inexplicable chain of events, <br/>yet paid little attention to his duties.<br/>Most of all, he injured my Lord...<p/><npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  \n...I cannot let this one slide...
526	Protect... who... for what...?
527	Am I... capable of being a Paladin?
528	<username/>\n
529	Can't you see the path for the Knight of Light...?\nBelieve in yourself.\nThe road you are taking is the road to becoming the Knight of Light....\nHowever, there is still a long way to go.
530	<username/>\nYou have witnessed the real Paladin at Fiodh Forest. The Knight of Light.\nThe reason you still remember that is...\nbecause of a spirit... a blessing from the spirit...
531	<username/>...\nLook for Tarlach, a druid at Sidhe Sneachta.\nAsk him what you have witnessed in Fiodh Dungeon.
532	He is an outstanding Druid...\nHe can help you become a Knight of Light with his knowledge of spirits.
533	I'll always pray for you...\nDo not give up, <username/>...
534	Your love is enough to provide water for those that are thirsty for one\nand your love is enough to provide seating for the fishermen that have spent all day fishing, and\nyour love is enough to make those sailors forget about a hard day at work
535	Your love is enough for women to rise up and\nyour love is enough for the kids to enjoy their surroundings.\nYour love is enough for even the birds to rest their wings
536	No word can adequately describe your true beauty, so\nit leads me back to you, same as yesterday.\nI so miss your beauty that shines like a precious jewel, that\nit leads me back to you, same as yesterday.
537	But every time I stand before you,\nI can't help but be shy and overwhelmed.\nThe hardest thing to do then is to look at you straight in the eye.
538	When I tried to stir up something,\nthat was out of hatred towards myself for not being able to look at you in the eye.\nI stand before you, befuddled and deaf. How tragic.
539	Never did I realize that\nthe stirring-up on my part would cause such pain on you.\nNever did I realize it was I who caused grief.
540	So I stand before you, speaking your name softly.\nYour name is enough to make a beautiful song.\nI still can't believe how beautiful you are.\nAnd I still can't believe how inadequate my words are to accurately describe your beauty.
541	To those in need of the nature's blessing...\nFear not.
542	You are now part of nature.\nYou shall breathe, live, and learn from it.
543	That will be your test.\nA test to see whether you are worthy of wearing the Spirit Armor.
544	Have you come this far...\nyou, who have been blessed by the spirits?
545	Show me what you have learned by becoming one with the nature.\nIt is time for you to unveil the depths of your power and wisdom.
546	Prove it to me that\nyou are worthy of a candidacy for Paladin\nby defeating me.
547	You have learned much more than I expected...\nAre you the knight that was mentioned in Morrighan's prophecy?
548	Then from here on out, I shall submit myself to you.\nUse my power to achieve justice onto this world.
549	From here on out, you and I are one.\nHowever, I cannot stay with you forever\nsince I belong in the world of the Spirits.
550	Call me when you need me.\nI will be there for you, no matter what.
551	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\n<username/>...?<br/>Yes, I have been waiting for you.<br/>... Did you have a chance to talk to the leader of Paladin?
552	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nYes. I ordered my men to bring you here so I could talk to you in private.<br/>...I heard that you had been digging up dirt on me these days.<br/>...I cannot just sit and watch you spread false rumors about me all over Emain Macha,<br/>and that is the reason why you are here with me.
553	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nI myself have also found quite a few things about you.<br/>I am also aware of the individual that asked you to dig up the dirt on me.
554	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... However, I'm not sure of his whereabouts...<br/>... so I need your help locating that individual.
555	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nYou can either tell me right now...<br/>... or I will have to take matters into my own hands... hahaha...
556	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nThere's no need for that, Esras!
557	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nWell... well...<br/>So it was you, Redire.<br/>Long time no see.
558	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nI knew something was fishy when I heard about your "death"...<br/>Now that you are back, you are trying to stand in my way...<br/>you know, you are just as idiotic as before.
559	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...However, it is too late.
560	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nSilence, you traitor!<br/>I have gathered more than enough evidence of your treacherous deeds.<br/>I also know of your true intentions!
561	<npcportrait name='nesras'/><title name='Esras'/>\n... Sure you do.<br/>However, what exactly did I do wrong here...?<br/>I never cooked up schemes that I could not do,<br/>and I never lied to anybody.
562	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nI am only guilty of...<br/>trying to ensure that everyone here lives a happy life...
563	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nHave you forgotten that it was you <br/>who proudly abducted a Fomor's daughter?<br/>It is I who worked overtime to cover up your stupid deeds.<br/>Don't forget that it is I who made you a legend in this town as an honorable Paladin. Don't you ever forget!
564	<title name='Redire'/>  <face name='anger2'/> \n...Hmmm...<br/>Silence. No more from the serpent's tongue!<br/>Where is Lord Rian!!<br/>What have you done to my Lord!!!
565	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nNothing... Absolutely nothing...<br/>By the way... if you are in search of "the Lord"... you won't find one here...<br/>if that's the answer you were looking for.
566	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nThat should answer your question about... Rian...
567	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\n... This was much earlier than I expected, but...<br/>it's for the best, I suppose?
568	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nHurry! Follow her!<br/>That treacherous thing is trying to do something despicable using our Lord Rian!
569	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nRight here! There's no time! We must find Lord Rian!
570	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nYou take care of the monsters.<br/>I'll look for the Lord.<br/>... Trust me on this one.
571	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nYou both are much slower than I thought.
572	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nEsras! Where's the Lord!<br/>What did you do to him!!!
573	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nThe Lord...? Oh...<br/>Are you talking about Rian...?<br/>I don't know if you are qualified to<br/>ask me about the well-being of "the Lord."
574	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nAnswer my question!!! Where's my Lord!!!
575	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nHahahaha.... Since you seem desperate to find out, here, I'll give you an answer.<br/>... You are looking at the new Lord of Emain Macha.<br/>I've been the Lord of Emain Macha for quite some time now.
576	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... And soon... the Lord of Erinn...
577	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n...What?<br/>You must be out of your mind...
578	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nYou sound confident as usual, Redire...<br/>However... that only holds true if you have power to back it up.<br/>Let me show you an example of what that means.
579	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... This Golem...<br/>No... no way... Is it Tabhartas....?
580	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nNo wonder you were the leader of Paladins.<br/>You instantly recognized this Golem...
581	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... Yes. This is Tabhartas.<br/>The gatekeeper of the Ancient Wisdom...<br/>and now, a loyal servant of mine who will carry my order of<br/>getting rid of you once and for all...
582	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='doubt'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nOh my gosh... the whole body is covered in Gold...<br/>I didn't know you'd resort to this...
583	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smlie'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nWell... this is all thanks to the Paladin trainees.<br/>As you might already know, Tabhartas is the prototype for all Golems...<br/>It took me a while to control him myself.
584	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nSo please... have some respect for him. <br/>He's not just another ordinary Golem.
585	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n...<username/>!! Do NOT leave my side!
586	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nTabhartas... I will now give you an order.<br/>Show your loyalty by crushing those invaders!
587	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\nAhhhhh... my leg...<br/>it's broken...<br/>I can't believe this...
588	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nEven a so-called Paladin like you is rendered useless<br/>in front of a monster like Tabhartas.<br/>Hahaha...
589	<npcportrait name='nprice'/><title name='Redire'/>\nAhhhh...<br/>...do not say the name Paladin with your serpent tongue!!!<br/>The real Paladin... The Knight of Light... shall be invincible!
590	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nSo ... this proves that you are not the true Paladin.<br/>Then where is this true Paladin that should come riiight about now...<br/>... to save you?
591	<npcportrait name='nesras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nTabhartas, finish him!!!!
592	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n<username/> !!!!
593	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nOh... that was either very brave... or very very unnecessary. <br/>Most humans don't even stand a chance against a regular Golem...
594	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n<username/>!!!<br/>... Move over!!<br/>Save yourself! We do not need to create more casualties!
595	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nI take it that you can take some more pounding.<br/>That's a lot longer than I expected.
596	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nHowever, you are only human, which means the end is near.<br/>...Your destiny has been decided...<br/>Death by Tabhartas. It was your call, not mine.
597	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n<username/>.... No....<br/>Forget about me...just run!
598	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nWhat is that!!!
599	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... This... cannot be...<br/>... the Knight of Light...
600	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... The true power of the Knight of Light...?
601	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nThis is not happening!!! A kid like you cannot and should not be the true Paladin!!!
602	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='shout'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...Ahhhh...<br/>... Tabhartas, I am giving you an order.<br/>Annihilate the kid so the kid will never see the light again!
603	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nI can't believe this... T... Tabhartas...<br/>gone... just like that...
604	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... You... must... be... the...<br/>... Knight of Light...??<br/>... No... it's just an urban legend. No...
605	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nPaladin...?<br/>... and Tabhartas?
606	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... So it is you...<br/>who caused all that chaos in the dungeon...
607	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nIt looks like one of those ancient Golems...
608	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... Wait a minute... then this must be controlled by the kind of magic<br/>that isn't proper by any means...
609	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI knew it. So it would use a human sacrifice to control this Golem...
610	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nOf course... this can only be thought of by a human...
611	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nRian...? Rian?
612	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nRian!!!!! Rian!!!!
613	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rager'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nWho is it.... Tell me...!!!!<br/>Who did this to Rian!!!
614	<npcportrait name='nesras'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... It's... that... Paladin!<br/>That Paladin was responsible for Lord Rian...!!!
615	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nYou... It's you again!!!<br/>You are the one who harmed Triona...!!!
616	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...!!!
617	<npcportrait name='ndark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nMorrighan... you succeeded....<br/>You awakened the kid as a true Paladin <br/>much faster than I expected...
618	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Why... why...<br/>Triona, Rian...<br/>... Why... what did they do to you...?
619	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='rage'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!<br/>Save... him... <br/>... Save him!!!!
620	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/> <face name='rage'/> <title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!
621	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\nRian!!! Rian!!!<br/>No... NO!!!
622	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Why... Why...<br/>Why do you not respond to my tears and pleas for help, Morrighan??
623	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n... What else do I have to lose for you to answer my pleas...??
624	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... Let's go back, Ruairi.<br/>I'll help you channel that anger into the kind of power no one has ever seen.
625	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... I will give you the kind of power to punish this world <br/>without having to rely on the power of gods.<br/>... The power will be yours.
626	<npcportrait name='Ruairi_G2'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Ruairi'/>\n<username/>... I'll never forget your name...<br/>... Never, ever...
627	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...!!!
628	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n<username/>... It is not your fault.<br/>The Lord was probably long gone<br/>when he became a sacrificial offering for that Golem....
629	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n... You are trying to put the blame on others, Redire.<br/>You should take responsibility for Rian's death, as well.
630	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nDon't you remember?<br/>That night... The Lord was injured by your sword...<br/>... and lost his life after all the Fomors retreated...
631	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... What...?<br/>The Lord passed away...<br/>during the great tragedy of Emain Macha...?!!!
632	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='adverse'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nYes. I did not announce his death at the time.<br/>But I could not just sit there and watch you cause<br/>all that chaos and tragedy...
633	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n... Are you saying... you used the corpse of The Lord...<br/>to control that Golem...?
634	<npcportrait name='price'/><title name='Redire'/>  <face name='anger'/> \n... Wait, even worse...<br/>The Lord has ruled Emain Macha all this time<br/>... as a dead man...??<br/>Impossible!!
635	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nThat is not true...<br/>Even in death, he followed my order to the fullest.
636	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\nI mean, to tell you the truth... I've been the Lord of Emain Macha all this time.
637	<npcportrait name='price'/><title name='Redire'/>  <face name='anger'/> \n...!!!<br/>N... Necromancy!!!<br/>I thought it was forbidden for Druids...
638	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n...!!!<br/>You are not a Druid, afterall.<br/>You were a necromancer all this time...<br/>How dare a necromancer try to govern Emain Macha!!!
639	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='smile'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nHahaha... that took you a long time to figure it out.<br/>Think about this, though... Emain Macha thrived like never before under my watch...<br/>It proves that a necromancer is better equipped than a druid to lead, no?
640	<npcportrait name='price'/>  <face name='anger'/>  <title name='Redire'/>\n!!!!
641	<npcportrait name='esras'/><title name='Esras'/>\n... I still have more than enough corpses and Gold to follow my orders...<br/>All I need to do is to find another Golem at Ceo Island and make another Tabhartas,<br/>and if I can find the ancient wisdom...<br/>I won't be stopped. Ever!
642	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='anger2'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nBefore all that, though... you two will have to pay for<br/>slightly delaying my grand scheme of things...
643	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='giveup'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\nNo... It is not happening...<br/>You are not even in Paladin form...
644	<npcportrait name='esras'/>  <face name='giveup'/>  <title name='Esras'/>\n...My dream... my... future...<br/>cannot... be... stopped.... now... No.... .
645	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nYou fought well, <username/> ...<br/>You didn't let me down. <br/>You have become the Knight of Light, as I expected...
646	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe power you have acquired...<br/>and the path you took in order to do so...<br/>definitely tells a story.<br/>Please use your power wisely...
647	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... I can sense the power of Cichol expanding.<br/>However, what worries me the most is his minions, the Dark Knights...
648	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n<username/>....<br/>Please watch out for those Dark Knights...<br/>They will do everything in their power to bring darkness and chaos upon Erinn...
649	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n<username/>....<br/>When darkness engulfs Erinn,<br/>please shine a light through the darkness as Paladin<br/>and protect Erinn from eternal darkness.

668	\n<npcportrait name='walter'/><title name='Walter'/>\nHmmm... that would be tough.<br/>\n<p/>\n
669	\n<npcportrait name='tracy'/><title name='Tracy'/>\nAhhhhkkk! Ahh!! Just wait and see! I'll hunt down a golem and prove that I'm a real man!!<br/>\n<p/>\n
670	\n<npcportrait name='walter'/><title name='Walter'/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<p/>\n

686	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nThis must be Math Dungeon...<br/>\n<p/>\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nI suppose so... Be careful. It could be dangerous.<br/>\n<p/>\n
687	\n<npcportrait name='MANUS'/><title name='Manus'/>\nHey, there... Please help me...\n<p/>\n
688	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nWait a sec. A healer?<br/>\nYou're a healer and you can't take care of yourself?<br/>\nWhat a joke...<p/>\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nGet lost.<br/>\n<p/>\n
689	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nNerys, don't be so mean... let's give him a hand...<br/>\n<p/>\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nSigh. It's just a waste of time helping someone like him...<br/>\nWhatever. I won't be a part of it.<br/>\n<p/>\n
690	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nThank you so much for your help!<br/>\nWhat's your name? I'm Manus, by the way...\n<p/>\n
691	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nI'm Nerys.
692	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nThis is my friend.<br/>\nHow can you be so weak and call yourself a healer?\n<p/>\n
693	\n\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nI'm still in training... and I've got to admit, it's quite embarrassing being caught like this.<br/>\nYou two are really strong, not to mention having fancy weapons...\n<p/>\n
694	\n\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nHey, Nerys. Why don't we stay at a nearby village?<br/>\nAll that traveling is starting to wear me out.\n<p/>\n
695	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nShould we? Yeah, this is starting to get old...<br/>\nHow about running our own Weapon Shop? I can make them and you can sell them.\n<p/>\n
696	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nOh, then how would you consider opening a shop in our castle?<br/>\nDunbarton Castle has neither Weapons Shops nor Blacksmith. People are forced to make a long journey just to buy weapons.\n<p/>\n
697	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nI see! Could you lead us there?<br/>\n
698	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nNerys, we got pretty lucky with this, don't you think?\n<p/>\n
699	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nAh... Okay, let's get going.\n<p/>\n
700	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nThis must be Math Dungeon... It's quite creepy...<br/>\n<p/>\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nI suppose so... Be careful. It could be dangerous.<br/>\n<p/>\n
701	\n <npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nHey, ladies!<br/>\nTwo young ladies in a dungeon... It's quite dangerous in here, you know?<p/>\n
702	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nA healer always helps those that may be in danger.<br/>\nI shall accompany you and offer a hand.\n <p/>\n
703	\n<title name='Nerys'/>\nWow! Thank you, sir gallant knight!<br/>\n<p/>\n
704	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nHa ha, better not leave me!<br/>\n<p/>\n
705	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nAhem. Are you okay, ladies?<br/>\nI find it unlikely that you two frail ladies can keep much of a fight like this...<br/>\nHere's an advice: why not stay in Dunbarton and run a business of sorts?\n<p/>\n
706	\n\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nUmm... Business...<br/>\nWe're interested in weapons. Is there a Weapons Shop in Dunbarton?\n<p/>\n
707	\n\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nNo Blacksmith, no Weapons Shop. If you would like to run one, you should open one near where I live.<br/>\nI think it would be better than just roaming around, being susceptible to danger.\n<p/>\n
708	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nNerys, let's settle down like he says.<br/>\nI'm sick and tired of traveling...\n<p/>\n
709	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nSir Manus, could you please guide us to Dunbarton?<br/>\nWe're a bit scared to get there by ourselves...\n<p/>\n
710	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nVery well, fair ladies.<p/>\n
711	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nAlright. I shall take you there. Follow me!\n<p/>\n
712	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nThis must be Math Dungeon... It's quite creepy...<br/>\n<p/>\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nI suppose so... Let's just turn back.<br/>\n<p/>\n
713	\n <npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\n Hey, ladies... Please help me...<br/>\n <p/>\n
714	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nHuh? Us? It's our first time in a place like this too, so...<br/>\nYou're a healer, aren't you? Why don't we find our way out together?\n<p/>\n
715	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nNerys, I'm scared. Let's get out of here.<br/>\n<p/>\n
716	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nShould we? I'd like to get out of here, too. This place is creeping me out...<p/>\n
717	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nWe've had enough of this adventure. Let's settle down at a town somewhere and open a shop.\n<p/>\n
718	\n<npcportrait name='manus'/><title name='Manus'/>\nHow about opening a business in Dunbarton?<br/>There is a spot for lease near my home.<br/>\n<p/>\n
719	\n<npcportrait name='nerys'/><title name='Nerys'/>\nOh, really? Should we open a Weapons Shop?<br/>\n<p/>\n
720	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Nerys' Friend'/>\nYeah! That's a great idea, Nerys!<br/>\nWe're going to run a Weapons Shop!\n<p/>\n
721	\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Spider'/>\nIn the past, I was nothing but an ordinary spider whose sole purpose was to spin cobwebs.<br/>\nI never stopped to wonder what I was doing, nor why.<br/>\nI would simply spend days mindlessly roaming around, with no purpose in life.<p/>\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Spider'/>\nI don't remember how, or even why.<br/>\nI somehow found myself outside my usual territory, lost deep inside Alby Dungeon.<p/>\n<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='Spider'/>\nThere, inside the dungeon, I came across someone.<br/>\nAnd that someone changed my life forever...\n<p/>\n
722	\n<npcportrait name='black_wizard'/><title name='Black Wizard'/>\nA spider in a dungeon like this?<br/>\nHmm...<p/>\n<npcportrait name='black_wizard'/><title name='Black Wizard'/>\nYou, too, must have been desperately fleeing from Humans...<br/>\nIf you are prepared to serve the eternal will of the Goddess,<br/>\nI shall grant you a new destiny as I did to the others.<br/>\n<p/>\n

726	\n<npcportrait name='dilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nWhat are you doing here all drunk?!<br/>\nGet a hold of yourself and let's get out of here!<p/>\n
727	\n<npcportrait name='lassar'/><title name='Lassar'/>\nShut it, you stupid healer!<p/>\n
728	\n<npcportrait name='dilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nSeriously... What made you drink this much?<p/>\n
729	\n<npcportrait name='lassar'/><title name='Lassar'/>\nHey man, I can drink with the best of them!!!<p/>\n
730	\n<npcportrait name='lassar'/><title name='Lassar'/>\nAre you the Giant Spider?! Then come and get it!<p/>\n
731	\n<npcportrait name='dilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nCalm down...<p/>\n
732	\n<npcportrait name='ldilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nYes! We won!!!<p/>\n
733	\n<npcportrait name='lassar'/><title name='Lassar'/>\nWe won? It's that simple??<p/>\n
734	\n<npcportrait name='dilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nLassar, you can't even walk straight. I say you had too many drinks.\n <p/>\n
735	\n<npcportrait name='lassar'/><title name='Lassar'/>\nUh... I'm perfectly fin... *hiccup*<p/>\n
736	\n<npcportrait name='dilys'/><title name='Dilys'/>\nOh, boy...<p/>\n

738	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nHehe... I'm so happy to go on a picnic with you, mom and dad.<br/>\nMom, is this Fiodh Forest?<br/>\nThen there must be a bunch of clover leaves around here!<p/>\n
739	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nHa ha... Oh, Ibbie... You were begging for a week to go on a picnic, weren't you?<br/>\nBut, what do you want to do with clover leaves, honey?<br/>\nThe fairies will be very angry if you pluck out the flowers.<p/>\n
740	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nHehe... It's a secret!<p/>\n
741	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nUm... Dad? What's behind those hills?<br/>\nI want to go there with you, Dad.<br/>\nPlease take me there. Please?<p/>\n
742	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nThat's Bangor.<br/>\nIt's a filthy village located in the corner.<br/>\nOur little princess doesn't belong there.<p/>\n
743	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nHoney. I'm hungry. Let's eat, OK?<p/>\n
744	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nIt's much too early...<br/>\nIf you eat now,<br/>\nyou'll be hungry when we head back.<p/>\n
745	\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nHmm... Why?<p/>\n
746	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nPlease be patient, dear.<br/>\nIt's been a while we've had a picnic like this, remember?<br/>\nAll you did last time was eat.<p/>\n
747	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\n...<p/>\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nYou know it's not easy to have a picnic like this, dear.<br/>\nTry not to worry too much.<br/>\nThe less I work, the less luck I seem to have...<p/>\n
748	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\n(Luck...)<p/>\n
749	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nYou know nothing but work.<p/>\n
750	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nUm, can I take a look around?<p/>\n
751	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nAlright, but don't go too far.<br/>\n
752	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nOK.<p/>\n
753	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nTomorrow's daddy's birthday.<br/>\nI'll get a four-leaf clover<br/>\nfor dad, who works very hard for us!<p/>\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nMy friends told me there are lots of four-leaf clovers around here.<br/>\nIf daddy gets luckier,<br/>\nmaybe he'll start working less.<p/>\n
754	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nI should hurry,<br/>\nor the rabbits will eat them all.\n
755	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nI wonder where they are... I wonder where they are...<br/>\n
756	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nThey said there are lots here...<br/>\n
757	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nBy the way... I don't see Ibbie.<br/>\n
758	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nAh! There they are!<br/>\n
759	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nHehe... There's a lot here!<br/>\nThere has to be at least one here.<br/>\nThis one's for daddy... This one's for mommy...<p/>\n

764	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nI'm so happy to go on a picnic with you, mom and dad.<br/>\nBut, mommy, what's this forest called?<p/>\n
765	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nThis is Fiodh Forest.<br/>\nThey say Fairies live here.<br/>\nThis your first time here, right?<br/>\n
766	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nWow...<br/>\nUm... dad?<br/>\n\n
767	\n<title name='Ibbie'/>\nWhat's over those hills?<br/>\nI want to go see what's there, daddy. Please?<p/>\n
768	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nIt's Bangor. A dirty little town.<br/>\nIt's something you won't be interested in.<br/>\nWe won't be going there.<p/>\n
769	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nHoney. I'm hungry. Let's eat, OK?<p/>\n
770	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\n...<br/>\n
771	\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nDid I say something wrong?\n
772	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nDear...<br/>\nIt's been quite a while since we've had a picnic like this, remember?<br/>\nI hope we enjoy ourselves for once.<p/>\n
773	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\n...<p/>\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nSometime, I just can't understand you.<br/>\nIt's not like what I've said was rude...<p/>\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nYou're worrying too much.<br/>\nIt's not easy to go on a picnic<br/>\nlike this for me. I hope you understand that.\n
774	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\n... Here we go again...<p/>\n
775	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nUm, can I take a look around?<p/>\n
776	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nAlright, but don't go too far.<br/>\n
777	\n<npcportrait name='ibbie'/><title name='Ibbie'/>\nOK.<p/>\n
778	\n<npcportrait name='bryce'/><title name='Bryce'/>\nHoney, this is the most important time in my years of work.<br/>\nBesides, I'm exhausted...<br/>\nI hope you can sympathize with me just a little.<p/>\n
779	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nI loved you for your passion.<br/>\nI had hoped that you would direct that passion towards me and our family.<p/>\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nI know you're having a difficult time.<br/>\nI just want you to pay a little bit of attention to Ibbie and myself every once in a while.<p/>\n
780	\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nIf I didn't pay attention to you and Ibbie,<br/>\nwhy would I be working this hard?<p/>\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nYou don't seem to understand me at all, even though you say you do.<br/>\nYou know that I work not because<br/>\nI enjoy it, don't you?<p/>\n
781	\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nWhy are we always returning to this argument?<br/>\nCan't you at least let me relax on a day like this?<p/>\n
782	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nYou...<p/>\n
783	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\n... nevermind...<p/>\n
784	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nBy the way... I don't see Ibbie.<br/>\n
785	\n<title name='Bryce'/>\nDon't worry.<br/>\nShe should be nearby.
786	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\n...<p/>
787	\n<title name='Ibbie's Mom'/>\nShe's a frail little girl. I'm going to look for her.<p/>

793	<npcportrait name='bryce'/> \n<title name='Bryce'/>\nI must go find them.<p/>

1017	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...!!!
1018	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Since the humans are busy restoring the Statue of Goddess,<br/>your way of revenge will bring us<br/>nothing but a waste of time and strength.
1019	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nYour job is to initially break the Statues,<br/>and then concentrate on delaying their restoration process.<br/>... All you need to do is buy some time before Triona becomes Macha.

1036	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Then stop it right now.<br/>You don't need to go through this....
1037	<npcportrait name='triona'/><face name="tear"/><title name='Triona'/>\nRuairi... This is my destiny.<br/>I've been chosen to go through that path.<br/>Ever since the day I was born...
1038	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="worry3"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nTriona...!!!
1039	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\n... I know this is going to be a painful, painful experience.<br/>I would be consumed by the other being that has been inside me all this time.<br/>I may even look totally different after this...
1040	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\nBut... even when I am in pain,<br/>I would never blame it on anyone else.<br/>All that blaming and hating doesn't make my pain go away, you know.
1041	<npcportrait name='triona'/><face name="smile"/><title name='Triona'/>\nThe feeling of love... pain... and suffering...<br/>they are all just feelings that let me know that I am alive and well.
1042	<npcportrait name='triona'/><face name="smile"/><title name='Triona'/>\nIf I am in a place where I am all alone, then<br/>I wouldn't be able to feel any of those emotions... love, pain, suffering, happiness... all that.<br/>If I don't feel any of those... then will I ever feel like I am alive?
1043	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><face name="sulky"/><title name='Triona'/>\nIf it's my fate, my destiny... then I just accept it, no questions asked.
1044	<npcportrait name='ruairi_n'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nNo...!!! That's not right!!<br/>You can't... you can't...<br/>you can't possibly withstand it all like that!!
1045	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\n...Ruairi...
1046	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="think"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nTriona...<br/>You were asking me... about my father, right...?
1047	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nMy father... was the lord of the town.<br/>He was placed there after his efforts in the Mag Tuireadh War.
1048	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="worry1"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nBut... After a while, he started acting like I wasn't even around.<br/>I was coming up with different ways to please my father, but<br/>all he did was smile meekly at me...<br/>and never said anything to me.
1049	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I only heard of a story that I have a fate that has already been set in stone.<br/>I didn't even get to hear THAT from my father! <br/>Seriously, what kind of a destiny am I placed in??!!!
1050	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="sulky2"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I didn't care about the position of the lord. I never wanted one.<br/>I only wanted to be accepted by my father... that's all.
1051	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\n...Ruairi...
1052	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... That's when I made my decision...<br/>that if my destiny is something my father dearly fears,<br/>then it's up to me to beat that.
1053	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nThat's how I have lived my life since.<br/>Me, making my own decisions, being the boss of my life...
1054	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Although I was unable to be at his side when he passed away...<br/>... I have no regrets...
1055	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nFate? Destiny? That's all a lie.<br/>It's meant to be fought against... and to overcome.<br/>Even if that means losing your identity, your friends, and your family...
1056	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I still have...
1057	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="worry3"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\nAhh... What am I saying...
1058	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\n... Don't worry about it, Ruairi...<br/>I am alright...
1059	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="worry2"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n...Triona...
1060	<npcportrait name='triona_n'/><title name='Triona'/>\nWell, then...
1061	I want to be the lady of Ruairi's life...
1062	I want to be in Ruairi's arms...
1063	... even if I become someone that I am not...
1064	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nHoh... a nobody had snuck in...
1065	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nHahaha...<br/>were you also looking for Lia Fail...?<br/>You must be wanting to stop the summoning of Cromm Cruaich...
1066	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... but it's all for naught.<br/>Paladin, the only thing you destroyed was<br/>the barrier that protects the Dragon...<br/>It wasn't Lia Fail.
1067	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n...Take that Paladin away!<br/>I'll do the questioning myself!!
1068	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nYou... you...<br/>the ultimate traitor of the Fomors!!!
1069	<npcportrait name='kristell'/><title name='Kristell'/>\nIt's been a while, Morgant.<br/>... This is someone that's very important in Erinn...<br/>I'll take this person myself.
1070	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... Second time already...
1071	<npcportrait name='dark_lord_n'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... Not someone I can just go easy on...
1072	Is this the kid...\nthat survived?
1073	... Yes. Please take care of him.\nAs his father was an exceptional knight,\nI hope you raise him to be as exceptional as his father.
1074	Don't worry about it, sir.
1075	Hey kid, what's your name?
1076	... I am...Aodhan...
1077	Hoh... why do you seem so tense?\nAnyway, from here on out, I am your family. Understand?
1078	... Understand.
1079	... Is that the kid I brought...?
1080	Yes, he is.\nHe's not only exceptionally talented, but very much driven as well.\n... He's my special protégé.
1081	Wouldn't it be great if you can pass the torch to him\nonce you retire?
1082	Hahaha, should I be holding this position\nfor THAT long?
1083	Bring the people down West!!
1084	All guards must protect the gate!!\nProtect the gate until\nthe Paladin Knights return!!
1085	Sir! It's dangerous here!!\nLet me take care of things here, and...
1086	Aodhan!\nTake the women and children and help them find a safe place to hide.\nFind the ones that still haven't evacuated!
1087	Sir! You should go with them, too...!
1088	I may be old and retired, but I am still a Knight.\nThese guys are nothing!
1089	But sir...!\nI... just can't let you stay here by yourself!
1090	Aodhan!!\nWhat do you think your predecessors sacrificed for?!!!\nHave you forgotten my teachings?!
1091	Can you honestly guarantee that the Fomors aren't\nlined up in front of the exit gate of the castle?
1092	Sir... I'll be back fast. Please...\nplease... Hold on... until I get back...!!!
1093	Go, Aodhan! Just go!!
1094	That was the last time I ever saw him alive...
1095	I knew later that\nhe sacrificed his life to save me...
1096	To my father, the rest of the family, and,\neveryone else that lost their lives at the hands of the Fomors during the war...\nEvery breath I take is in rememberance of them...
1097	I thought it was because I was weak.\n... to see people that are important to me perish right in front of my eyes...
1098	...I thought the only way to prevent that is to become stronger than ever.\nThat was the motivation for training as hard as I did...\nand yet... Nothing changed.
1099	... Now no one remembers my teacher.\nEveryone seem way too eager to avoid the painful past at all cost.
1100	Regardless of my combat prowess,\nthe world still required the good people to make sacrifices,\nand it has now gone to the point where it's the norm.
1101	I walk the path of a knight...\nI do not fear being sacrificed for the good of others...\n... I am ready.
1102	Seeing others die...\nNow that, I can't stand that. 
1103	So her father also....
1104	Does she have relatives...?
1105	I heard she has a mother, but...\nif she couldn't show up for the funeral, then...
1106	Oh no... sigh...
1107	Even her father... that was way too reckless of him...
1108	Shhhh... She could have heard you...
1109	By the way, what's that...?
1110	Wow, dad. I really love this book!
1111	You really like it like that?
1112	Yes, thanks a lot, dad!!
1113	After you finish reading, promise me to tell me what the book is all about, okay? Hahaha...
1114	Yes, I will!
1115	... I love you, princess.
1116	Eavan... Hide here.\nDaddy will help others first and come back.
1117	No, daddy! Don't go!!!\nStay with me dad!! \n... I don't want to lose you, daddy!!!
1118	Eavan, family is important for everyone...\nif something happens to you or your mom...\n...I won't ever forgive myself for that.\nIt'll be the same... for everyone else, too.
1119	... Daddy does this because\nI love protecting other people.
1120	Dad...
1121	After I come back, promise me\n... to tell me the story from the book, okay?
1122	... Daddy... .
1123	... I love you, princess.
1124	Sniff... sniff...
1125	Pssh, you don't even have a father. What's with the attitude?
1126	No... My daddy passed away fighting the Fomors.\nHe helped others escape!!!
1127	Liar! Who dies for other people?! \nThat's just stupid. Right?
1128	Of course! Who does that\nthese days?
1129	Hahh!!
1130	Hey!! Give it back!!!
1131	Hahaha, come and get it!! Here, here!!
1132	Nooo... noooo!
1133	Nooooo!!!!!!
1134	Dad... is making a sacrifice...
1135	as valuable as\n... you said it was...?
1136	Can nothing be saved... without any sacrifice...?
1137	... People quickly forget those that sacrificed for others.\nThey don't even take time to thank you.
1138	... I don't want to believe it.\nBut... but then...
1139	Please answer me, daddy...
1140	<username/>...
1141	<username/>... \nCan you... hear me...?
1142	<username/>...\nCichol's seal is starting to suffocate me again...\nIt's trying to link the two worlds together...
1143	I am focusing all of my energy on blocking the path\nbetween Erinn and the Other World...\nI do not have enough strength to break out of the seal...
1144	If I get sealed up...\nand Macha resurrects...
1145	Macha is much more powerful than I am...\nErinn will be engulfed in a flame of destruction...
1146	The only thing holding Macha back from resurrecting right now is time...\nPlease help us, <username/>...
1147	Before she resurrects...\nbefore she brings the God of utter destruction...
1148	Please prevent the reawakening of Macha and help me...
1149	Please stop the resurrection of Macha...
1150	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\n... I knew you'd end up here, <br/><username/>...
1151	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="sulky2"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... Since you can't do it alone,<br/>you brought yourself a friend...? <br/>All you people think like that...

1157	<npcportrait name='tarlach'/><face name="anger"/><title name='Tarlach'/>\nRuairi... Why are you...<br/>on the Fomor's side...?
1158	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... I am not siding with the Fomors, Tarlach...<br/>... I am only taking the path I believe in.
1159	<npcportrait name='ruari_G3'/><face name="think"/><title name='Ruairi'/>\n... If there's an ounce of goodness remaining in between the humans and Fomors...<br/>then there's got to be a way to communicate...
1160	<npcportrait name='tarlach'/><face name="thinking"/><title name='Tarlach'/>\n......
1161	<npcportrait name='tarlach'/><title name='Tarlach'/>\n... I know.<br/>... But...

1168	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAre you too preoccupied with the past<br/>to forget our big picture...?<br/>Did you forget the calling of the Dark Knight...?<br/>... Eliminate them at once!!!

1196	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nAhhhh... Ruairi!!!
1197	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... This is for damaging me as a human being.. How dare you...
1198	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n......
1199	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... I cannot forgive you, Cichol.<br/>How can a human being be so cold and heartless...?
1200	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThat's the question I have for you, Morrighan...<br/>Why do you keep siding with the humans...?
1201	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHow can you show compassion to these<br/>ungrateful, despicable beings?<br/>Why do you wish to protect them from<br/>the punishment they clearly deserve for going against God's ways?
1202	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nIs it a must to punish the humans<br/>to let them know of God's presence?<br/>All forms of lives have their right to live to the fullest<br/>until their times come!
1203	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nI'll ask you this, Morrighan...<br/>What are Fomors to you...?<br/>Are you saying they aren't a form of life...?
1204	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAnd besides... even the humans don't<br/>necessarily share your view...<br/>See how they treat other forms of life... like them!!!!!!
1205	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nNo way... Humans are kind-hearted by nature...<br/>they accept changes, they grow leaps and bounds, and<br/>mold their world as idealistically as possible..<br/>That's what the Gods have always wanted from the start...
1206	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe war between the humans and Fomors stem from...<br/>... nothing more than you tricking the two into<br/>fighting one another... over a lie!
1207	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nA lie...?<br/>Did you just say it's all a LIE...?<br/>Hahahahaha....<br/>funny... I didn't think I'd hear that from Morrighan's mouth...
1208	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nMorrighan...<br/>... knowing what went on but withholding the truth is<br/>as good as a lie.
1209	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n...!!!!
1210	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Why did you hide the truth from the humans...?<br/>Why did you hide the fact that Tir Na Nog is, in fact, Erinn...?
1211	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThe Other World you guys refer to isn't Tir Na Nog.<br/>ERINN is Tir Na Nog...<br/>You humans are already living in the paradise, and yet<br/>you still repeat the mistakes and fight over human things.
1212	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Admit it, Morrighan.<br/>You are the one who's been using Milletians<br/>in the name of good vs. evil...<br/>... I can only stomach your hypocrisy for so long...
1213	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... Tha... that's different!!<br/>That's different!!!
1214	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHahaha... Morrighan, do you honestly believe that<br/>if the humans are in Tir Na Nog, they'll live a happier life?<br/>Is that really what you think?
1215	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Humans don't appreciate happiness<br/>unless they experience pain and sorrow first.<br/> That's how foolish they are.
1216	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nIt's unforgivable to think those unstable creatures<br/>wind up being the chosen ones, living in paradise...<br/>I only wish to set the world back in order,<br/>where it's supposed to be.
1217	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Now, the new world is right on the horizon.<br/>Destruction is just a step towards the ultimate freedom.<br/>If you stand in my way once more...<br/>I will not stand idly by this time. Move!!!!
1218	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... No way.<br/>It's all over now, Cichol.
1219	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... Your Army of Darkness and Dark Knights have all but perished...<br/>... The resurrection of Macha has failed, and<br/>it will be impossible for you to summon Cromm Cruaich now.
1220	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... I will now seal you up,<br/>... with the power that was used to seal me up in the past.
1221	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHuhuhu... Hahaha...
1222	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHahahahahah!!<br/>You want to seal me up, Morrighan?<br/>... You really don't need to do that.
1223	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nIn case you aren't aware,<br/>Macha isn't the only one that can summon<br/>Cromm Cruaich...
1224	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n...!!!
1225	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nYes. He's the one that made the contract with Cromm Cruaich...<br/>He was dealt as the offering for the Dragon<br/>thanks to his father's never-ending quest for power.
1226	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n...The true product of the abominable nature of humans!!!
1227	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... Now, Cromm Cruaich!!!<br/>I will now allow you to complete your end of the contract...
1228	<npcportrait name='cichol_n'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n... so come out and follow my order!!!
1229	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n... Cromm... Cruaich...!!!
1230	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHahaha...<br/>I am sure you remember the time, Morrighan...<br/>the time when your body turned into stone... and the pain you suffered as a result...
1231	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHahaha... That paradise that's exclusive to humans...<br/>Cromm Cruaich will do its best to completely annihilate that place!!!
1232	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nTir Na Nog will now be combined with the cursed world of the Fomors<br/>and return to the state it should be in!!!
1233	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAll this was caused by human greed!!<br/>Now!! Stop us if you can!!!!
1234	I am sorry... <username/>...\nCromm Cruaich... The Dragon of Destruction... the one being too dangerous for anyone to combat against...\nI have now made a barrier surrounding you and Cromm Cruaich...
1235	Please... \nplease slay Cromm Cruaich...\nDefeat the evil Dragon, and...\n... bring peace to...\nErinn... no, Tir Na Nog...
1236	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nTo the insignificant being that lives by the moment...<br/>What made you call out my name...?
1237	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nI see... I see...<br/>is this to fulfill the contract you have with me...<br/>I think it's a bit earlier than expected, but... <br/>well, there's not much of a difference.
1238	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n... And besides, you aren't the one that summoned me here...
1239	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nHmmm... There's no need to explain what made you summon me. <br/>It is probably no different than the previous requests...
1240	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nEven an eternal figure like me have noticed that<br/>a lot of time has passed since the last time I was summoned... <br/>and yet humans are still ignorant, and the Fomors are still unwilling to adapt... <br/>...this is quite a tragedy...
1241	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nHmm... even so, for a mere human being to<br/>try to take down the rock that's shaped like me...<br/>that must have required a lot of courage and conviction...<br/>... I am actually a bit interested in you...
1242	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n<username/>...<br/>You must be the human being that is hailed as a hero in this world,<br/>the one who is a part of this world, but not exactly from this world...<br/>Your heart is still filled with chaos the Goddess left behind.
1243	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n<username/>...<br/>... Were you not aware that Erinn is indeed Tir Na Nog...?<br/>Were you not aware that Tir Na Nog goes to both the land of Fomors and Erinn...?<br/>... I do not wish to blame you for this, but... you are still human afterall...
1244	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nYou must have also been aware of the story by the Fomors that<br/>if someone unworthy of being in paradise, actually enters one,<br/>then that place will cease becoming a paradise...hahah....<br/>
1245	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nThat's right... your judgments have been clouded by<br/>the infinite greed that is innate in all humans....<br/>Greed allows humans to look forward,<br/>but it also distorts the vision of truth.
1246	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nRemind yourself this over and over again, human.<br/>The source of discontent and tragedy is<br/>neither Fomors nor anyone else...
1247	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nIt's the greed within you,<br/>which refuses to recognize another equal being, and instead,<br/>forcefully submits it under your will...
1248	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nEven if you do not necessarily pay for these sins,<br/>in the end, those that are closest to you<br/>will pay for it in great agony...
1249	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\nThat's the law that governs this world...<br/>The fact that the humans refuse to acknowledge it is<br/>indeed, the root of all tragedy...
1250	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n... You may not completely understand what I have just told you,<br/>but remember it with your heart.<br/>You will know sooner or later...
1251	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n... This red-headed human<br/>is already contractually bound by me in an invisible rope,<br/>with the contract you humans have offered...
1252	<npcportrait name='dragon'/><title name='Cromm Cruiach'/>\n......This human being has only suffered in your world,<br/>where the rules have been largely ignored...<br/>I do not wish that on anyone,<br/>so I'll take him a little earlier than expected.
1253	Love them... and take care of them...\nWhether it be a human being like you, or other living creatures...
1254	whether it be the world you live in...\nor, most importantly, the very being that lives and breathes everyday, YOU...
1255	Differences will disappear in the name of understanding,\nand that would be the true calling of\nbeings like you that have come to this world.
1256	That's how the world will be shaped and formed...\nthrough your very own two hands...
1257	... The next time you summon me,\nI hope to see more things in Tir Na Nog\ngo through positive changes...

1278	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="smile2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nSo... Macha did not resurrect, right...?<br/>And Erinn... is safe, right...?<br/>... Wow... you just accomplished something very important...
1279	<npcportrait name='Eava'/><face name="smile2"/><title name=''/>\n(I gave Eavan back the used Protection Charm)
1280	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="shyness"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nOh, this... is that ring...<br/>You brought it back.<br/>Thank you so much for returning.<br/>I am just glad I was able to help you in this.
1281	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nWell... then...
1282	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Eavan'/>\n.......
1283	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Eavan'/>\n<username/>!!! Wait...!!!<br/>Waaaaiiittt!!!
1284	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="smile2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\n... I don't want to say it like this... but...
1285	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="shyness2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\n... I... I have... <br/>I have been tormented by the past.
1286	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="shyness2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nI understood the importance of making a sacrifice for others, but<br/>I couldn't wholeheartedly accept it, nor could I admit that.
1287	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="shyness"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nBut now...<br/>I can understand where my daddy came from...<br/>when he decided to sacrifice himself for others...
1288	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nA value that's much bigger than life itself...<br/>something that one wants to protect, even risking life for it...
1289	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nIf not for your heroic effort, <username/>,<br/>then I don't think I would have ever realized that... <br/>there is such a thing...
1290	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="smile2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\n... Now I feel like I can understand why<br/>... you are being hailed as the Knight of Light...<br/>why you're being called Erinn's Savior.
1291	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="normal"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nIf I get a chance to do it again...<br/>I will.. help you in any way shape or form...<br/>And...
1292	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="smile2"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nEven if for some reason I forget you down the road...<br/>I will never forget the fact that<br/>I was here to protect you...
1293	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="calm"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nThat's what made realize who I really am...
1294	<npcportrait name='Eavan'/><face name="love"/><title name='Eavan'/>\nThank you, <username/>...
1295	Out of thousands of spirits out there,\nthe Goddess chose you.
1296	\nWhile I was awaiting your arrival,\nI had a dream.\nA dream of you coming to me.
1297	And... miraculously,\nhere I am, face to face with you.
1298	I think this all means that...\ninstead of you being the chosen one,\nI think I was the one chosen\nto be with you.
1299	Thank you...\nfor coming to this world...

1310	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="smile"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nSigh... sorry.<br/>I didn't want to say this to you like this, but...
1311	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="sad2"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\n... I ... had been bound by the past for the longest time.
1312	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nThe fact that I didn't want to see or make any sacrifices...<br/>was just my selfishness masking my inner weakness...
1313	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="sad"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nI was too blind to understand a simple, logical concept that<br/>I should have valued whatever I cold have done at the moment,<br/>instead of dwelling on the feeling of failure on things I couldn't do...
1314	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="calm"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nRight now... right now...<br/>I think I can understand my teacher's mindset<br/>when he made the decision to sacrifice himself for others.
1315	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="smile2"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nIt took me a long time... but<br/>I think I have finally understood the logic behind it...
1316	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="happy"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\n... I think I can truly understand now<br/>why you're called the Knight of Light...<br/>... the Savior or Erinn...
1317	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="smile"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nAnd also...<br/>even if, god forbid, I forget you down the road...<br/>I don't think I'll ever forget the fact that<br/>I was here to help you out on your journey.
1318	<npcportrait name='Aodhan'/><face name="happy"/><title name='Aodhan'/>\nThat's what made our bond<br/>so special and significant...

1343	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... I have been waiting for you.<br/>Are you the one... that seeks...<br/>... the Armor of Darkness...?
1344	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\nNo need to be surprised.<br/>I also heard the voices of the armor pieces...<br/>the piece you have originally belongs to us...<br/>...and I am here to take it back. Hahaha...
1345	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... But, that's not what I think...<br/>... the piece of armor you have is already bonding with one another,<br/>forming a semblence of an armor...<br/>... not only that... for the Fomors, those armors are abundant.
1346	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... If you really desire to don the armor...<br/>then... I'll give it you.
1347	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... Now put on that armor...
1348	Yes... be my master... <username/>...\nIn a few moments...\n... you and I will become one...
1349	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\nDo you hear the voice of the armor, <username/>?<br/>I believe the armor has mutually selected you as the one as well... muahahaha!
1350	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\nNow don the Armor of Darkness and<br/>sweep away the Goddess that thinks lowly of you, and the ones that serve her... the Paladins.<br/>Every time you slay a Paladin, you will find yourself that much more powerful.
1351	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n...I see ... is this indeed a big quandary for a Paladin...?<br/>Maybe it is... haha...
1352	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... There is no need to deny it. There's no need to rush things.<br/><username/>.<br/>Place the item I'll give you in Barri Dungeon and immerse yourself in the power of Dark Knight.<br/>After that, once you decide to become the Dark Knight,<br/>come back to me and let me know how you felt about experiencing that power.
1353	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... Talk to Dougal, and<br/>you'll be able to see me here at Albey Dungeon at all times.
1354	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\nYou do not need to bring the armor here. I have plenty with me.
1355	<title name='Black Wizard'/>\n... But the choice is yours.
1356	... I now peg this person\nas the one that draws power from the greed and desire within...
1357	Oh, the power of darkness,\nmay you provide the eternal power\nto your obedient servant!!!
1358	(gasp, gasp)
1359	(gasp, gasp)

1361	Keep fighting, Ilis!
1362	My legs... my legs...\nI can't move them...
1363	It's alright. It's nothing. Hold on just a bit more!!!
1364	Why... I already let them know in advance...\nWhy... why am I the one going through this...?\nI'm scared... really scared...
1365	Ilis!!!
1366	Wait for me!!\nWait till I get there...!!!
1367	Ilis!!!
1368	... It would have been better for you if you didn't come.
1369	... Do you hold a grudge against me...?
1370	... You know I can't do that...\n... I really do not want to battle you, Duncan.
1371	I can't believe you did that...
1372	Ilis...\nwhy...?
1373	... come back... Ilis...
1374	Too late... Duncan...\nDoing what's right and what's wrong does not apply to me...\nI... I only wanted to exact revenge on everyone that ignored my pleas.\nI wanted them to feel the exact pain I felt...
1375	... and...\n... I just wanted to walk again...
1376	......Ilis.
1377	I am sorry...\nbut... Everything has been accomplished already. \n... For me... this was the only choice.\n
1378	Ilis!!!!!!

1655	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>There is an old legend that goes like this.<br/>Once there was a village with a strange disease going around that would affect people to suddenly lose their memory.<br/>Soon, the disease spread throughout the entire town<br/>and the town residents would even forget the name of common everyday items.
1656	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>While this was happening, there was this young man who had yet to contract the disease.<br/>He went around putting labels on every item, trying to minimize the damage done by the disease.<br/>He would write labels such as 'This is a tree.', 'This is a sheep. Please shear the sheep.'<br/>'This is a chicken.  It can lay eggs.' and so on.
1657	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>The young man placed a very large sign at the town entrance.<br/>On it he wrote, 'God exists.'
1658	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>There is a moral to this short story.<br/>What we call memory is so incomplete<br/>and that everything we've accumulated over our entire lives<br/>can burst like a bubble in an instant...
1659	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>Starting from a simple cooking recipe or how to make a potion,<br/>to the memories you shared with close friends and your loved ones;<br/>they will one day all disappear.

1661	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>Kelpie, you too must understand.<br/>This has been brought upon by none other than Phaselus himself.
1662	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>... So, Kelpie, I see that you've ended up witnessing everything as well.<br/>  You're right.  The hideous Desert Ghost...<br/>That is the true nature of Elves.
1663	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>Irinid didn't just leave their blessing on Iria.<br/>They left with us Elves, an unforgettable curse.<br/>The Desert Transmogrification is an incurable disease that has resulted from the curse.
1664	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>Every Elf in Filia has no choice but to one day turn into<br/>one of those disgraceful Desert Ghosts just like Phaselus.
1665	<npcportrait name='castanea'/><title name='Castanea'/>\n<br/>I love our Elf race more than anything.<br/>I believe I can sacrifice anything<br/>for it.
1666	I don't want them to discover the dark truth\nand be in despair because of it.
1667	So we must use the Memory Tower to erase their memories.\nWe must sacrifice the past in order to save the hope of tomorrow.

1793	After the days of the great flood, there was one Conduction Ceremony.\nThe one who was chosen as the Gold Dragon's Conductor was Cessair, who was from a noble family.
1794	Cessair's darkness swallowed up the Gold Dragon\nand the dragon brought upon an era of eternal darkness with the name, 'Moonlight of Death'.
1795	However, the seemingly endless days of darkness\nfinally ended with the appearance of Irinid.\n\nAnd with that, the era of the dragons was over.
1796	After a few thousand years passed\nfate has planned for yet another Conduction Ceremony.
1797	I, Cromm Cruaich, am guiding the dragon's contractor to Iria\nin preparation for the Conduction Ceremony.

1873	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nAs I expected, the defense is well established.<br/>I've only come this far. Could I really succeed?

1880	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nFallon! I discovered the hidden intention of the Fomors.<br/>The reason they continuously chased after the Erg of Darkness<br/>is due to their desire to transmutate Claimh Solas,<br/>the key to Noitar Arat.

1886	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nBut you have been fighting harder than anyone for the royal family of Aliech<br/>with your supposed loyalty. How could you...?
1887	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nI suffered from despair and disappointment since the conclusion of the Mag Tuireadh battle.<br/>The warriors have shed a lot of blood and even sacrificed their lives for victory,<br/>but nothing has changed.
1888	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nI fought in the war to pursue my dreams,<br/>but I soon realized that my dream could not be shared.<br/>They had stolen my dream, leaving me without any glory or hope.
1889	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThat is when I met Lugh Lavada,<br/>who saved my life during the battle.
1890	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nHe, who had turned into Dark Lord Morgant,<br/>introduced me to the ideology of the Fomors,<br/>and it was only then that I was able to dream again.

1892	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI've already betrayed a close friend<br/>in hopes of saving Lena by using Alchemy.
1893	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nBut I realized that wasn't my dream or aspiration,<br/>but merely a selfish desire.<br/>I knew, the moment I awoke from the dream,<br/>that it had turned into a nightmare.
1894	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nFallon,<br/>I will do whatever it takes to stop the transmutation of Claimh Solas.
1895	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nAs you please.<br/>Just remember that only cruel realities await<br/>those who do not dream.
1896	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nTake him away!

1901	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Knights'/>\nYes, sir!
1902	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nIs it finally over...?
1903	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nIt appears we did not incur too much damage.
1904	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nGrrr, it was a trap!
1905	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nGuardsmen! Maintain the line!
1906	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThey outnumber us...<br/>Success seems out of the question...
1907	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nReady your weapon!<br/>Warriors of Tuatha de Dananns,<br/>Tara will remember us!
1908	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThe Knight of Light...
1909	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fallon'/>\nIt's Lugh Lavada!
1910	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Cai'/>\nSo, this is the truth behind the Shadow Realm!<br/>I can't believe it.<br/>What will master Dorren say when I tell her this?
1911	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Leymore'/>\nCai, we're currently on a very important mission we received from King Ethur Mac Cuill II.<br/>Could you focus a little more?
1912	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Cai'/>\nHaha, silly me.<br/>I tend to ramble on when I get anxious. Haha!
1913	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nBy the way, are we heading the right way right now?
1914	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nHmm, I'm not too sure. The flow of Erg ended somewhere around here so...
1915	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nHmm? What's that?
1916	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nWhat... What is this sound?
1917	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nCould it be...Glas Ghaibhleann?<br/>I can't believe my eyes.<br/>Glas Ghaibhleann was ultimately destroyed by the Milletians!
1918	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI think that old man Berched once told me that<br/>a monster like Glas Ghaibhleann can be recreated<br/>using the Druid's magic.
1919	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nNo, that Glas Ghaibhleann isn't something that was summoned with magic.
1920	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nIf magic was used to summon, the spirit summon effect would have been generated along with it.
1921	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI have a bad feeling about this...<br/>What could be going on<br/>here in the Shadow Realm?
1922	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Temple Knights'/>\nWho... Who are you?!<br/>Intruders! We have intruders!
1923	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\n<username/>, you saved me twice.
1924	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI hope there isn't a misunderstanding between us.
1925	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI was one of the Temple Knights in the past,<br/>and I was even on a mission to eliminate Leymore because I was ordered to do so by the Temple Knights.
1926	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nWhat I'm giving you now...<br/>contains the entire truth about me.
1927	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nHow is the life of a priest?
1928	<npcportrait name='collen'/><title name='Collen'/>\nIt's much more comforting than when I was a part of the Temple Knights, of course.<br/>But Jenna,<br/>have you come to see me because you had something to tell me?
1929	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI'm thinking about leaving the Temple Knights.
1930	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nIn the past, the purpose of my life was to fulfill my duties as a Temple Knight,<br/>and I was always prepared to sacrifice my life.<br/>That was the mindset I had, even though I wasn't old enough to understand the duties.
1931	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nBut I no longer have faith in the purpose and activities<br/>of the Temple Knights.
1932	<npcportrait name='collen'/><title name='Collen'/>\nIt won't be an easy decision...
1933	<npcportrait name='collen'/><title name='Collen'/>\nSo this may be your last mission<br/>as a Temple Knight then.
1934	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nAhhh...
1935	Lebbaeus
1936	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nAlthough it was a favor from the Dark Lord...
1937	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nIt was a mistake to accept you into our race<br/>when you don't have a drop of our blood in you.
1938	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nNow, here I am, paying for my mistake with the blade of betrayal in front of me.
1939	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nLebbaeus,<br/>I only wanted to know your destiny.
1940	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nHaha! Destiny, you say?<br/>An Incubus like me doesn't have such a thing as destiny.
1941	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nIncubuses are incomplete beings<br/>that can only live off of<br/>other people's dreams.
1942	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nThe moment we awaken from long slumber<br/>is the start of death for us...
1943	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nIf you truly wanted to wake up from sleep<br/>and breathe the aroma of death...
1944	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Lebbaeus'/>\nI, Lebbaeus, shall help you!
1945	Elatha
1946	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nWait...!
1947	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nThis is the region.<br/>This is the last location where Erg will be confirmed.
1948	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Fomor Alchemist'/>\nOh, good.<br/>We can shorten the time.
1949	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Shadow Lancer'/>\nWho's there?
1950	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nCircumstances don't allow enough time for us to go into the details,<br/>but I just want you to know that it wasn't our intention<br/>to side with the Fomors.<br/>It was an inevitable decision we had to make when Jenna's safety was in jeopardy.
1951	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nWe don't have much time.<br/>They will soon come for us.
1952	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI'll create Barrier Spikes and stall them.
1953	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nThis Torque I'm giving you has important clues<br/>that I've collected in the Shadow Realm. It'll help you.
1954	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nThere are a few things remaining<br/>that I still need to take care of before leaving the Shadow Realm.
1955	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Tethra'/>\nI don't understand.<br/>I don't understand why you want to spend so much energy thwarting our plan.<br/>Does your determination stem from prejudices you have against the Fomors?
1956	Tethra
1957	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nYou people have always been that way.
1958	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nRather than embracing the differences,<br/>you people have always resorted to threatening the other races with your swords.
1959	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nSome things will<br/>never change!
1960	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nPuhaha!<br/>Your condescending actions misled me to believe that you were some sort of a fighter.<br/>Boy, was I wrong.
1961	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nI'll finish you!
1962	<npcportrait name='Tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nLife Drain!
1963	Fa... Fallon...?
1964	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nHow much you've grown in such a short time.
1965	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nWho are you!
1966	Alchemist Tiamat
1967	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nI don’t know how you were able to defeat Glas Ghaibhleann,<br/>but we'll soon find out if you can handle the Bewilder skill!
1968	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nHeh heh, I'm impressed that you've come so far.
1969	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nBut I think it's time I finished you.
1970	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nEeeeyaaaawp!
1971	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nTiamat!
1972	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nHa, look who it is.<br/>It's Cai, the back-stabber.
1973	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nIt wasn't enough that you betrayed a friend, huh?<br/>You had to betray the Fomors, too?
1974	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nHaha, so tell me, now that you belong in neither the darkness<br/>nor the light, what to make of you?<br/>Have you come to become a Shadow Walker<br/>that roams around the Shadow Realm forever?
1975	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nYour rubbish ends<br/>here!
1976	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nLife Drain!
1977	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Alchemist Tiamat'/>\nHow in the world do you know how to use the Life...<br/>Ahhhhhhhhhk...
1978	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nAre you really Cai the Alchemist...?<br/>I've heard about you.
1979	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nYour Leymore's friend, aren't you?
1980	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nLeymore...
1981	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThe most renowned Alchemist in the world,<br/>as well as my best friend whom nothing in this earth can replace.
1982	But Leymore can no longer\nclaim me as a friend.\nI've betrayed our friendship.
1983	Leymore was the first one to fully understand\nthe secret behind the Shadow Realm,\nand he was the first one to warn me about its dangers.
1984	I was desperate to learn Alchemy\nand I just had to get to the bottom of it all, you know.\nBut I wasn't the only one that wanted to uncover the secret.
1985	In hopes of learning the secret, I entered into a contract with them.\nAnd I pushed my friend out of the way.
1986	The reason that I was so desperate was Lena.\nWith Alchemy, I was convinced that I would be able to\nbring my one true love back to life.
1987	That was what kept me going...until now.
1988	But no matter how hard I chased that dream, I never could make it come true.
1989	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\n<username/>!!<br/>The tabernacle of Noitar Arat has been eliminated!<br/>You'll be able to call Adniel!
1990	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nAndras, Granat, Karpfen!
1991	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Andras'/>\nWe'll do whatever it takes to keep these guys away.<br/><username/>, why don't you go ahead and prevent the transmutation of Claimh Solas?
1992	<npcportrait name='karpfen'/><title name='Karpfen'/>\nKarpfen can handle it alone!
1993	<npcportrait name='granat'/><title name='Granat'/>\nPlease, go ahead and stop Claimh Solas.
1994	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nI will do that!
1995	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI haven't witnessed such systematic and strategic movements<br/>from the Fomors recently.
1996	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nIt won't be easy to break the defense line...
1997	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nThe only thing I can do is give it my best!
1998	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nOkay!
1999	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nThe tide of the war in the Shadow Realm has already turned in favor of the Fomors.<br/>Don't you think it would be wiser to give up now?
2000	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nTethra!
2001	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nOh, a Milletian?<br/>I'm surprised to see you alive.
2002	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nDon't expect any mercy from me!
2003	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Shadow Warrior'/>\nI can't believe I have to take orders from some human like Fallon...<br/>How shameful.
2004	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\n...
2005	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI'll wait for the right moment<br/>to escape.
2006	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nStop!
2007	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Shadow Warrior'/>\nAren't you...!
2008	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Shadow Warrior'/>\nHow did the Fomor defense line break so quickly...?<br/>Well, it's alright. I was beginning to get bored.<br/>I'll teach you a lesson!
2009	'<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThey fortified the defense...
2010	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThat device is an oven that can transmute Claimh Solas<br/>using the Erg of Darkness.<br/>
2011	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nWe have no choice but to ask <username/> for help.<br/>Stay back and request support until the mines have been installed.
2012	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nNow, let's go!
2013	The wings of a dead bird shall begin fluttering.\nAnd the light will be consumed by darkness...
2014	<username/>...
2015	You are bound to the Soul Stream by destiny...
2016	You must enter the Shadow Realm...
2017	And prevent the Soul Stream's destruction...
2018	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\n...?!
2019	Glas Ghaibhleann
2020	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nI have a bad feeling about this.<br/>I should keep out of here. It seems dangerous...
2021	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nNow is the time!<br/>Begin attacking!<br/>Ice Mine!
2022	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nAre you <username/>?<br/>Thank you for accepting the summons.
2023	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nI'm Fallon, the Royal Guard Captain of Aliech Kingdom<br/>as well as the Commanding Officer of the Shadow Realm Expeditionary Force.
2024	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThe Expeditionary Force is currently struggling because we're significantly outnumbered<br/>by the Fomors, who have taken over the Shadow Realm.
2025	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nRecently, a group of Alchemists found some clues regarding the expansion of the Shadow Realm<br/>which has helped us reach the conclusion that all of Erinn, including the Soul Stream,<br/>is in danger.
2026	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nA crisis will break out in Erinn.<br/>What Erinn needs at a critical time like this is help from a hero like yourself.
2027	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nHow did this happen?!
2028	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Jenna'/>\nUghk...
2029	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nI hear something...<br/>Perhaps a survivor?
2030	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Jenna'/>\nUggggghk...
2031	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='Jenna'/>\nAhhh, I must have been unconscious for a while.
2032	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nWho are you? You don't seem to be one of the guardsmen from the Expeditionary Force...
2033	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nI've brought an Ice Mine as Fallon requested.
2034	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nIt's too late...
2035	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThere has been a large-scale attack from the Fomors<br/>and, as you can see, Fallon's unit has been wiped out.
2036	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nOh no, not again...
2037	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nSoon, the Fomors will begin their attack.
2038	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nReady your weapons if you want to survive! Right this minute!<br/>And we better install the Ice Mine you've brought.
2039	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nHmm...?
2040	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nShe was just here.<br/>Where did she go...?
2041	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nCai!
2042	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nLeymore... Jenna...<br/>I'm sorry.<br/>I can't bear to look at you.
2043	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nCai, are you alright?<br/>You've been seriously hurt!
2044	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nDon't worry about me. Take care of <username/>.<br/>If we don't destroy the tabernacle of Erg that Cichol has created<br/><username/> will be in danger!
2045	<npcportrait name='adniel'/><title name='Adniel'/>\n<username/>, what brought you to Renes<br/>isn't your will alone,<br/>but your destiny. It is that which beckons you to Soul Stream.
2046	<npcportrait name='adniel'/><title name='Adniel'/>\nThe transmutation of Claimh Solas has begun<br/>and the door to Noitar Arat is about to open.
2047	<npcportrait name='adniel'/><title name='Adniel'/>\nGo down to the Shadow Realm<br/>and stop Soul Stream's destruction.
2048	<npcportrait name='adniel'/><title name='Adniel'/>\nAdniel shall be with you in the final moments<br/>and my Horn Bugle will remain as the symbol of our promise.
2049	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nHa... I can't believe I lost.<br/><username/>, eh?<br/>You've grown much stronger.<br/>Though you're but a Milletian, it was an impressive battle.
2050	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\n*Heh heh* But it's too late<br/>to stop Claimh Solas.<br/>It's too late...
2051	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nThe Fomor's dream...<br/>Tethra's dream...
2052	<npcportrait name='tethra'/><title name='Tethra'/>\nFinally...
2053	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThey lost their commanding officer, but they don't seem to be perturbed.<br/>If anything, the enemies seem even more aggressive and powerful.
2054	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nIf we delay more time here<br/>everything will come to naught!
2055	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nWe don’t have much time.<br/><username/>! I'm counting on you.<br/>Go and stop Claimh Solas from transmuting.
2056	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI'm a bit worried...
2057	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\n<username/> is the only hope<br/>we have left at this point.
2058	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nWe don't have anyone else to count on...
2059	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI can't believe you've rescued me...<br/>I don't quite understand the intention behind your support.
2060	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nIt was a favor from your friend, Leymore.<br/>Leymore will be here to help you soon.
2061	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nWhat...? Leymore, did you say?
2062	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nWe can't just sit here and do nothing.<br/>I'll stop Claimh Solas from transmuting!
2063	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\n*Sigh*<br/>This won't be easy.
2064	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nJenna!
2065	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nDid Priest Collen send you?<br/>I'm sorry to have worried you.
2066	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nBut it's not just because of Leymore.<br/>I can't say I'm free of blame<br/>when it comes to the Shadow Realm,<br/>as I was a part of the Temple Knights in the past.
2067	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>Alright! The barrier has been destroyed.<br/><username/>! Hurry up and request Adniel for help!
2068	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nCai, I don't have a choice but to eliminate you,<br/>regardless of your ties,<br/>if you stand in our way...
2069	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nTake him away!
2070	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThe warriors shed blood <br/>and sacrificed their lives for the victory,<br/>but nothing had changed.
2071	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nI fought in the battle<br/>to pursue my dream.
2072	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nBut that dream<br/>belonged to them,<br/>and could never be mine.
2073	That is when I met Lugh Lavada,\nwho saved my life during the Mag Tuireadh battle.
2074	When I met him,\nhe was not the Knight of Light\nbut the Dark Lord.
2075	But he showed me the\nideology of the Fomors\nthat overshadowed the foolish hopes of the real world.
2076	And I was able to dream again.\nMy own dream, this time...
2077	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nAlright!<br/>I'll go ahead first then!
2078	<npcportrait name=/><title name='<username/>'/>\nIt was a favor from your friend, Leymore.<br/>Leymore will be here to help you soon.
2079	The shackles of the burning land is broken...
2080	and lifeless soil is seeping through...
2081	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nIs this the Dragon Egg that Legatus mentioned?
2082	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nWo... Wow... That pillar...
2083	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\n... For some reason it doesn't feel unfamiliar.
2084	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nBut something doesn't seem right...
2085	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI don't have a good feeling about this.<br/>No, he's trying to self-detonate right now.<br/>Look out!
2086	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nLook out!
2087	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nLeymore!
2088	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nPlease... You promised me.
2089	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nYou promised to be safe...<br/>You said you'd return to me.<br/>Please... Don't leave me like this...
2090	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\n...
2091	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI think this is my chance to ask Leymore for forgiveness.
2092	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI became an Alchemist in hopes of reviving Lena<br/>and I continue to engage myself in the Homunculus experiment.<br/>Though my efforts ended in utter failure,<br/>the possibility was still there...
2093	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nSoul Stream...<br/>Soul Stream became a clue.<br/>Using the Alchemy that uses one's spirit as an ingredient, Leymore may be revived...
2094	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\n<br/>I'll use my spirit.<br/>Watch carefully. Ha!<br/>This will be my last time practicing Alchemy!
2095	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nBut Cai,<br/>then you will put yourself in danger...!
2096	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThis is what Lena told me<br/>on her deathbed.
2097	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nAs any death is ill-fated,<br/>so is love.<br/>That is why love lingers in your heart for eternity.
2098	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI was foolish...<br/>Perhaps I still don't understand the depths of<br/>Lena's love for me.
2099	<npcportrait name='Leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nMmmm...
2100	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nLeymore!<br/>Can you hear me!?
2101	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nCai...

2114	<title name='Andras'/>I didn't want any help...<br/>You should have just left me to die...
2115	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>I was only pursuing my own quest.<br/>It had nothing to do with you.
2116	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>But isn't it too early for you to be <br/>roaming the shadows?
2117	<title name='Andras'/>It doesn't matter.<br/>No one cares about me anyway.<br/>No one likes me. No one...
2118	<title name='Andras'/>I look strange with these big ears.<br/>What else would people call me other than<br/>a monster?
2119	<title name='Andras'/>It might have been better for me<br/>if I had just been eaten alive by the Fomors.
2120	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>It isn't easy to control your destiny.<br/>If it were,<br/>a lot of things wouldn't be what they are today.
2121	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>I know it's painful,<br/>but you must get through this.
2122	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>I'm sure you'll find an answer<br/>to your destiny somewhere...
2123	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>\nCai!
2124	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nAlright!<br/>We did it.<br/>Transmutation of Claimh Solas<br/>will result in failure. Ha!
2125	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nCai,<br/>I can't quite figure you out.
2126	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nWhatever the reason may be,<br/>you once shared the same ideology as us.<br/>Am I right?
2127	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nHave you suddenly changed your mind<br/>because your hope of reviving Lena<br/>has turned into despair?
2128	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nNo, my hope has not turned into despair.<br/>I changed my mind after witnessing the hopelessness of the Shadow Realm!
2129	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nYou are wrong about the Shadow Realm, Cai.<br/>It may be the only hope remaining in Erinn.
2130	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nWhat is the truth you know and believe<br/>about the Shadow Realm?<br/>A place where Alchemy started?<br/>The place where the Erg of Darkness originated?
2131	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThe Shadow Realm is a parallel world to reality.<br/>It is a place where hopes and possibilities<br/>of knowledge and beliefs are realized.
2132	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThe Second Battle of Mag Tuireadh ended<br/>tragically for both<br/>the Fomors and the Tuatha De Dananns.
2133	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThough the Fomors fled,<br/>the Tuatha De Dananns, who were weakened by the restless war,<br/>had no choice but to hand over their authority to the Milletians.
2134	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nBut what would have happened if it were<br/>the Fomors that won instead of the Tuatha De Dananns?<br/>What if Lught, the Knight of Light, had not fought with his Cross Sword?
2135	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nIf the light of Claimh Solas had not vanished<br/>in Noitar Arat, the realm of darkness,<br/>Erinn would have evolved into something<br/>completely different from what it is now.
2136	<npcportrait name='fallon'/><title name='Fallon'/>\nThis is exactly why the Shadow Realm exists.<br/>It is a realm that offers possibilities that turns despair into hope.<br/>A complete revolution is possible in this realm.
2137	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nNo, that's not possible.<br/>I've come to understand one truth by studying Alchemy.
2138	<npcportrait name='Cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThe past remains only in our memory.<br/>It is impossible to revive or relive what has already happened in the past.
2139	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>\n'/>\nClaimh Solas?<br/>What is going on right now?<br/>I thought the transmutation of Claimh Solas ended in failure...
2140	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nIt did not end in complete failure.<br/>Although the transmutation was incomplete,<br/>Claimh Solas had partially evolved.
2141	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nWith that, Noitar Arat has been liberated.<br/>Erinn will undergo transmutation at the Fomors' will,<br/>and the Shadow Realm will infinitely expand.<br/>It will be only a matter of time before the light of Soul Stream fades away...
2142	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nNoitar Arat was not the beginning.<br/>The winter of destiny began,<br/>and Tir Na Nog and the age of gods were drawing to a close.
2143	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nGoddess Badhbh Cath, Neamhain. Has she begun to flutter her wings?<br/>Neamhain is known for her self-righteousness. How far could she involve herself in this?<br/>All hopes will perish in the face of the darkness of Noitar Arat...
2144	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>\n'/>\nYou are...!
2145	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHaha, must I introduce myself?<br/>I can't believe you don't recognize the King of the Fomors.
2146	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nA truly atrocious monster has been created.<br/>Who would have thought that the legendary sword of Nuada Airgetlam<br/>would get crushed like this. Haha!
2147	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThey say history repeats itself, right?
2148	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n<br/>The nightmare of the Mag Tuireadh battlefield...<br/>And the curse of Findias...<br/>Have become a reality after all.
2149	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI heard about you from Andras.<br/>She said that the Shadow Walker, who walks hidden in darkness,<br/>will know even the secrets of the Shadow Realm.
2150	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nElatha, please help me.<br/>I want to know the truth about the death of my friend, Cai.
2151	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nSo, even a Noitar Arat Alchemist was ultimately nothing more than a human. <br/>A being that's been determined to live for a limited time in search of the truth... <br/>This is indeed a sad fate, but I suppose humans would try seek comfort through grief.
2152	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nIf I told you that fate is the greatest of all human privileges,<br/>would you understand?<br/>I am not speaking of the tedious eternity that the gods must endure...
2153	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nA Shadow Walker is cursed <br/>to spend an eternity in suffering.<br/>A pain that is greater than death.
2154	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nThis is the penalty that Cai now faces<br/>for using the Alchemy of Caliburn<br/>to restore a friend's life.
2155	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nCaliburn?<br/>Cai couldn't have used the Caliburn!
2156	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nThe Caliburn was always in Cai's possession.<br/>Unfortunately, Cai wasn't skilled enough to handle the Caliburn.
2157	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nIt was a foolish decision. <br/>He knew better than anyone<br/>that using the Caliburn with the cylinder's crystal <br/>would consume his soul...
2158	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nIt is a curse brought on by<br/>a foolish Alchemist who ventured into a forbidden domain.
2159	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nArenen is late.
2160	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nHe said he would be here soon. <br/>He couldn't have gone ahead, right?
2161	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nWaiting here like this could be dangerous...<br/>Ilsa, let's get out of here for now.
2162	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nBrrr... It suddenly got so cold... <br/>My whole body is shaking like the first time I went grave stealing in Iria.<br/>In any case, I have to finalize this today.
2163	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nLooking only for the most idealistic and pure kind of love<br/>isn't going to work...<br/>I'll just end up searching forever like an Elf lost in Longa Desert<br/> until I eventually die of loneliness.
2164	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nIlsa may be a spendthrift, <br/>but she has a pretty face and a nice body. <br/>Not only that, but she's also stellar in math. I bet she had more schooling than me...
2165	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nBesides... I'm so irritable all the time, my skin is horrible, and <br/>my heart has been in poor condition since my youth.<br/>I wish I could just get married and live a healthier, more stable lifestyle.
2166	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nI wonder if this engagement ring, which I bought off of Nicca for a premium, is going to do the job.<br/>Actually, I'm sure it'll work!<br/>After all, it was made by a master gem maker in Tara.<br/>Ilsa will be moved to tears!
2167	<npcportrait name='arneng'/><title name='Arenen'/>\nIt's going to be today! I'm gonna leave for Uladh with Ilsa!
2168	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nCough Cough...
2169	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nIs this the power of the Milletians?<br/>I was foolish to underestimate you.
2170	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nWe Fomors have worked long and hard<br/>to obtain the Caliburn and Courcle's Heart.
2171	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nIf the Caliburn is said to be vested in shadows,<br/>Courcle's Heart can be said to belong to the light.
2172	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nThat is the reason the Fomors had such difficulty in obtaining it.
2173	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nBut now, the situation has been reversed.<br/>Neamhain, the Goddess of Light,<br/>is now siding with the Fomors...
2174	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nCourcle's Heart will soon<br/>beat with heart of the Fomors!
2175	Mata
2176	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nMilletian?<br/>Do you dare challenge Mata?
2177	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nI cannot believe the rumor of<br/>Tethra's humiliating defeat to a Milletian.
2178	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nIf you can dismount me from my horse<br/>I will give you the honor of confronting me personally.
2179	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThere is a Goddess that once disappeared</br>from Uladh due to a conflict with Manannan mac Lir.
2180	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThe Goddess crossed the ocean to arrive in Iria</br>where she dreamt of Tir Na Nog.</br>That dream, however, soon turned to despair.
2181	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\n'Tir Na Nog's Doom'.
2182	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThat Goddess was the first to utter those words.</br>Maybe everything started from her despair and rage.
2183	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nDo you still not understand?</br>Irinid was really</br>the Goddess Neamhain.
2184	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nPuhaha! </br>It seems that time has come to put an end to the Milletian legends.</br>Don't be too disappointed </br>at such a demise.
2185	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nNight has simply come a bit earlier than you expected.</br>When the promised end comes,</br>you will have no choice but eternal sleep...
2186	<npcportrait name='wovoka'/><title name='Waboka'/>\nAre you okay?<br/>I'm glad I wasn't too late.
2187	<npcportrait name='wovoka'/><title name='Waboka'/>\nKousai's premonition<br/>saved your life.
2188	<npcportrait name='wovoka'/><title name='Waboka'/>\nKousai asked me to deliver this message.
2189	<npcportrait name='wovoka'/><title name='Waboka'/>\nWarriors with true courage<br/>will never be a victim of their destiny<br/>since they are the masters of their own lives...
2190	<npcportrait name='wovoka'/><title name='Waboka'/>\nTake courage, <username/>.<br/>You are the only one who can prevent<br/>the end of the world.
2191	Cichol
2192	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nI've been waiting for you,<br/>Milletian.
2193	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nI would imagine<br/>that you never thought you would meet<br/>me in Iria. Especially here in this place known<br/>as Irinid's Ruins.<br/>
2194	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nI think I know what fear and terror<br/>drove the Milletians <br/>into the sandstorms of Longa.
2195	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nWasn't it Tir Na Nog's Doom?</br>Tir Na Nog's Doom, however, will not mean the end of the world.<br/>The will of the Fomors is simply to return Erinn<br/>to the way it was before the Milletians defiled it.<br/>The end will be reserved only for you Milletians!
2196	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nBut before that happens, it is best to remove any seeds of discord.<br/>Milletian, it is time for you to die.
2197	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThis is not our first meeting</br>so I suppose introductions are unnecessary. Puhaha...!
2198	Dark Lord
2199	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nElatha? <br/>I knew that such a day would one day come to pass but<br/>so much time has passed already...
2200	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI heard about Lebbaeus.<br/>You acted too hastily.<br/>Was there really a need to go so far?
2201	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nMorgant,<br/>I have not come to apologize about Lebbaeus.<br/>I come to learn of my fate.
2202	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nMorgant,<br/>I know that you played a part in my birth<br/>as well as the transaction with<br/>the Incubus kinsmen.
2203	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nAnswer me Morgant.<br/>Who am I and how did all of this start?<br/>I want to know the reason for this suffering.
2204	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nWas that the reason?<br/>Was that the reason you pointed your sword at the heart of your colleague<br/>and awoke from an Incubus dream?
2205	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nDidn't you realize that<br/>another nightmare would await you as soon as you awaken?
2206	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nI've already watched the death of Lebbaeus.<br/>I am sufficiently prepared.
2207	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nIf that is indeed your will...
2208	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI will tell you this much, Elatha.<br/>You will find your answer in Iria.
2209	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nSeed sown in Irinid's land.<br/>Its fruit shall also be harvested there...
2210	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nAren't you... <username/>, the Shadow Hero?<br/>Thank you so much...<br/>I thought I would never step foot in my hometown of Bangor again.<br/>What is this world coming to?
2211	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nI'm sure you've witnessed it<br/>yourself on the way here,<br/>but there are strange things happening<br/>inside Shadow Realm's Tara.
2212	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nEvil spirits, that look as if they've sprung<br/>out of the Metus valley far across the Moyer Ocean<br/>roam throughout the Shadow Realm...
2213	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nAnd Cai.<br/>Did you hear about the rumor that Cai the Alchemist<br/>has been seen inside the Shadow Realm?
2214	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nI didn't believe it at first either.<br/>At least, not until I experienced my nightmare.<br/>Cai is no longer human.
2215	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nOh, how he emitted darkness as he continued his slaughter...<br/>One by one, my comrades fell...
2216	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\nIt was horrific.<br/>As soon as I leave this place, I'm leaving the Royal Guard.<br/>I'm planning on returning home and joining the family business.
2217	\n\n<title name='Imprisoned Royal Guard'/>\n...The first day I entered the Royal Guard.<br/>My comrades who stood with me through thick and thin inside the Shadow Realm...<br/>They all seem like a dream now.
2218	Imprisoned Royal Guard
2219	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nWhew! That was close.<br/>Of all the places to propose to a girl!<br/>Only Arenen would pick such a ridiculous place!
2220	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nVoight, do you remember?<br/>Back when we were at the Qilla Base Camp? You, me, and Arenen... The three of us spent so much time together. 
2221	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nHaha, yes, I remember. We were all so foolish back then.<br/>And our hairstyles were so...<br/>I don't even want to think about it.
2222	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nDid you know?<br/>Did you know who it was<br/>that my heart was after all those times...?
2223	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nVoight... It was you...
2224	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nThe only reason I was able to stay with Arenen<br/>was because of the hope<br/>that I would get to see you.
2225	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nHuh? Ilsa!<br/>What are you talking about woman?!
2226	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nI still owe Arenen some money...and <br/>you're putting me in a really awkward situation right now<br/>by telling me this!
2227	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nVoight, <br/>this may be the last chance I'll have<br/>to tell you how I feel.
2228	<npcportrait name='ilsa'/><title name='Ilsa'/>\nI love you, Voight.
2229	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\nAr...Arenen. No.<br/>This is a misunderstanding. Arene-een!
2230	Defending is harder than challenging.
2231	She is a champion.
2232	Karpen the mighty falls for the sweetness of Tara honey.
2233	<npcportrait name='karpfen'/><title name='Karpfen'/>\nTara honey, I like...

2235	<npcportrait name='voight'/><title name='Voight'/>\n....Ar, Arenen
2236	<title name='Lost Elf'/>\nPlease help me.
2237	<title name='Lost Elf'/>\nI must get out of this place<br/>but I don't know how. 
2238	<title name='Lost Elf'/>\nMaybe it's because I am too far away from the Memory Tower.<br/>I can't seem to remember anything.
2239	<title name='Lost Elf'/>\nI don't even remember how to fight, but<br/>there are too many monsters in the Ruins.
2240	<title name='Lost Elf'/>\nPlease help me.

2267	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='키홀'/>\n하지만,<br/>네가 찾고 있던 네반은 이미 이곳을 떠났다.
2268	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='엘라하'/>\n멈춰라, 키홀.
2269	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='엘라하'/>\n이것이 의미 없는 학살이<br/>되리라는 건 뻔하지 않겠나?
2270	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='엘라하'/>\n티르 나 노이 종말 앞에<br/>이런 죽음들이 과연 무슨 의미가 있겠는가?
2271	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='키홀'/>\n이 죽음은 티르 나 노이의 종말과는 관계없는 일.<br/>모든 생명은 각자 자신에게 어울리는<br/>죽음을 안고 태어나는 법이다.
2272	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='키홀'/>\n나는 단지 그들에게 어울리는 죽음을<br/>선사하고 싶을 뿐.

2287	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nGoddess,<br/>tell me how I can return Cai to his original self.
2288	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nCai was not forced to take this path.<br/>It was a choice he had made for himself.
2289	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThrough Caliburn,<br/>Cai has become light itself.
2290	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nGoddess, please...<br/>I can't just leave Cai like this.
2291	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nHumans...always focusing on the here and now<br/>due to their limited perspective.
2292	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThe guardian of Caliburn is not an ember that will simply die out.<br/>It is the final light<br/>that will luminate Tir Na Nog's Shadow!
2293	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nCaliburn has been completed.<br/>Do you realize what this means?<br/>The time of confusion is coming to an end.<br/>Tir Na Nog will be purified by the light of Caliburn!
2294	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nTir Na Nog is no longer<br/>a paradise<br/>nor an eternal land.<br/>Rather, it is a land covered with the tears of suffering...
2295	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI dreamt of acheiving the ideals of Tir Na Nog here in Iria.<br/>But when I awoke,<br/>I realized that the dream was a nightmare.
2296	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThe age of the gods is coming to an end.<br/>Purifying Tir Na Nog<br/>before it becomes covered in shadows<br/>will be the Goddess of Light's last mission...

2298	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nIn return,<br/>I have prepared a special gift for you, Goddess.
2299	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nCi...Cichol...<br/>What are you trying to do?
2300	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nDidn't you and I<br/>have the same goal for Tir Na Nog?
2301	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nOf course,<br/>The purification of Tir Na Nog is also the will of the Fomors.<br/>Only difference is that the Fomors have chosen blood purification.
2302	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nBlood purification<br/>will begin with the destruction of the Soulstream.
2303	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\n...Cichol.<br/>Was this your plan all this time?
2304	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nCichol. Do not use that child.<br/>He...<br/>...He doesn't know anything yet.
2305	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nElatha is bound to me Cichol<br/>through a Noitar Arat pact.
2306	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHe forfeited his destiny<br/>so that<br/>he could save a useless life.
2307	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nElatha...
2308	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nI already know who you are.<br/>You are Irinid<br/>...as well as Neamhain,<br/>the Goddess of Light,
2309	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nand<br/>...my Mother.
2310	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nElatha,<br/>...I meant to tell you when the right time came.<br/>But now is not...<br/>No... Not like this.
2311	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nI always wondered<br/>about the reason behind<br/>my suffering and cursed destiny.
2312	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nI have finally found my answer.
2313	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThe time has come, Shadow Walker.<br/>Become the Doppelganger's Shadow!
2314	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nWhen the power of the gods that you inherited from your mother becomes absorbed in the Doppelganger,<br/>the Doppelganger of Destruction,<br/>that which will destroy the Soulstream, will be completed!
2315	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nYou do not have to do this, Elatha.
2316	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nYou have power within you.<br/>Power passed down from me.
2317	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThe power of light<br/>can even make the darkness of Noitar Arat<br/>disappear.
2318	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nAccept that power.<br/>My son.<br/>Accepting it<br/>is the destiny that you must choose.
2319	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nFrom the beginning,<br/>the Light was not my choice.<br/>It was not my destiny.
2320	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nIt was only your will.<br/>Will of the Goddess...<br/>That is the reason I have left the light<br/>and chosen darkness.
2321	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\n<username/>. <br/>I must leave this item with you.<br/>It is a music box that contains Andras's song.
2322	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nThere was one thing that kept me from becoming possessed by the shadow,<br/>despite walking as a Shadow Walker for so long.
2323	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nIt was the melody in this music box<br/>that always reminded<br/>me of my true identity.
2324	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\n<username/>,<br/>I will entrust you with the responsibility of protecting the Soulstream.
2325	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nAaahhh... No...!!!
2326	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nThe destruction of Soulstream has begun.<br/>We must stop it somehow!
2327	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nThe future has already been decided.<br/>Interfere no more!
2328	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nCichol!<br/>Did you think you could bring such shame to the Goddess of Light<br/>and still live?
2329	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI will not let this pass.
2330	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nNeamhain, my sister.<br/>Will you allow your hastiness to spoil things once again?
2331	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe Soulstream is about to be destroyed.
2332	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\n<username/>, the Soulstream is in danger.
2333	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nGo save the Soulstream.
2334	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\n<username/>,<br/>You will need this equipment to save Cai.
2335	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nPlease save my friend.
2336	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAll the gods together in one place.<br/>How long has this been?
2337	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nHaha... This shall then be the last banquet<br/>before the end of Tir Na Nog.
2338	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAah...is the last page of the prophecy<br/>regarding the end about to be filled?
2339	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThere is no such thing as a predestined future.
2340	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe last page of the prophecy<br/>will be rewritten by <username/>.
2341	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI suppose...<br/>there will be some sort of future.
2342	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\n...But will that truly be<br/>the future Tir Na Nog we had dreamed about?
2343	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>Stop! Cai!
2344	<npcportrait name='nao'/><face name='smile'/><title name='Nao'/><username/>, thank you for saving the Soulstream.
2345	<npcportrait name='nao'/><face name='smile'/><title name='Nao'/>But Tir Na Nog still needs you.<br/>So does Cai.
2346	<npcportrait name='nao'/><face name='smile'/><title name='Nao'/>I will take you<br/>to the place...<br/>where people await your presence.

2397	What Elatha revealed to me for the first time...
2398	was not his past,\nbut rather the pain he had endured for so long.
2399	A cruel curse\nwith no beginning or end...
2400	He suffered and endured.
2401	When he pointed his sword\nat Lebbaeus, a friend as dear to him as his own brother,
2402	he felt as if all the light in the world had disappeared\nand as if his heartbeat was no more.
2403	With light nowhere to be seen in this world,\nall he had left
2404	was the life of a Shadow Walker,\na ghost wandering amongst the shadows.
2405	But I knew him.
2406	I had remembered him\nfor a long time.
2407	I understood him.\nHis pain, his scars.
2408	...and darkness.
2409	I hope that in me\nhe will be able to forget the darkness.

2414	Descendants of Cessair!\nAre you watching Tir Na Nog, that which you defended with your blood, lives, and courage?
2415	There will never be any as courageous as you.
2416	Heaven and earth will come together, and peace will reign.
2417	Men will put faith in their glorious swords, women in new life,\nand everyone in love.
2418	But even such an epic age will soon come to an end.
2419	Flowers will not bloom, not even in summer.\nCows will be without milk.
2420	Trees will no longer bear fruit\nand fish will disappear from the oceans.
2421	Light will be hidden in darkness,\nlife will be hidden in death.
2422	People will lack faith in each other.\nBetrayal will fill the land and kindness will be seen no more. 
2423	These symptoms of Tir Na Nog's Doom\nwill start from Irinid.
2424	The world will finally come to an end.

2426	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nElatha?<br/>I knew that such a day would come one day,<br/>but so much time has passed already...
2427	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nI heard about Labbaeus.<br/>You acted too hastily.<br/>Was there really a need to go so far?

2429	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nMorgant,<br/>I know that you played a part in my birth<br/>as well as the transaction with<br/>the Incubus kinsmen.
2430	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nAnswer me, Morgant.<br/>Who am I and how did all of this start?<br/>I want to know the reason for this suffering.
2431	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nWas that the reason?<br/>Was that the reason you pointed your sword at the heart of your colleague<br/>and awoke from an Incubus dream?
2432	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nDidn't you realize that<br/>another nightmare would await you as soon as you woke from your sleep?
2433	<npcportrait name='elatha'/><title name='Elatha'/>\nI've already watched the death of Labbaeus.<br/><br/>I am sufficiently prepared.
2434	<npcportrait name='dark_lord'/><title name='Morgant'/>\nIf that is indeed your will...<br/>Seed sown in Irinid's land.

2462	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nYour blind faith in the Goddess has not changed.<br/>Why do you think that the Goddess must always be on your side?
2463	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nIs it because you fool yourself to be on the side of Light?
2464	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nArrogant fool.<br/>The reason that<br/>Irin...no, Neamhain...had to turn her back on Iria, Irinid's land,<br/>was because she was disillusioned by such arrogance.

2495	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nHow...how did you know my name?
2496	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nNot many survived the tragedy of Emain Macha.
2497	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nAs I expected, you don't remember anything.<br/>...Loss of memory.<br/>Is this the universal fate of all those who suffered through the nightmare of that Samhain night? 
2498	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nI was also in a similar state not too long ago.<br/>That is, until I recovered my memory using the Memory Crystal.
2499	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nWhat I want to know<br/>is the truth about my father's death.
2500	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI heard that you hold the keys to the truth.
2501	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nThe truth...<br/>Do you happen to know the other reason why people cover their injuries with bandages?<br/>It is because they lack the courage to face their wounds.
2502	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nIf you want to know the truth, you must defeat me here<br/>and take this Memory Crystal.
2503	<title name='Helvetius'/>\nBut before you make your move, you must ask yourself<br/>whether you truly have the courage to face the truth.
2504	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\n<username/>, it was you.<br/>To meet you again in a place like this...<br/>This is a strange fate.
2505	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\n...Hmm. If you are looking for the Alchemist in Shadow Realm,<br/>it might be related to my activities here.
2506	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI've been collecting clues regarding the tragedy in Emain Macha and my father's death.<br/>I'm slowly putting together the pieces of my lost childhood memories.
2507	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\n<username/>, I think we should work together from this point forward...<br/>It appears that our paths might cross.
2508	... Night time in Emain Macha
2509	The nightmares that have faded into the darkness of the night
2510	start to appear one by one.
2511	I've heard rumors\nabout a Fomor raid in Coill Dungeon.
2512	It was at night when I heard unpleasant murmurs coming from somewhere. 
2513	When I awoke from my sleep and looked out of the windows with my blurry vision,\nI saw a red glow of fire and plumes of dark smoke rising into the air. 
2514	The strange mutterings started to spread rapidly, like the plague.
2515	And strange footsteps grew louder.
2516	I heard my father's voice trembling.
2517	A cold hand...
2518	I think I grabbed my father's cold, shaky hands,\nand came down the stairs.
2519	When I opened the back door,\nI was taken aback by the intense heat. 
2520	A shadow was following us. I could hear it.
2521	...I heard my father's scream
2522	and watched him fall to the ground.
2523	Who knows how much time passed,\nbut when I came to...
2524	the Lymilark Temple Knights\nwere fighting the Shadow.
2525	Collen...\nThis was my first meeting with Collen.
2526	My lost memories are now slowly coming together.
2527	I think I can recall the voice\nbehind the shadow.
2528	They were voices belonging to humans,\nnot Fomors...
2529	They weren't Fomor.\n...they were human.
2530	...They were Alchemists.
2531	When voices of sorrow filled the land,
2532	light from the great spirit Irinid started to glow above the western sea.
2533	In order that the dragons might be confronted
2534	Irinid gave the sharp fangs of the Coyote to the Giants\nand the wisdom of the Falcon to the Elves.
2535	As darkness cannot remain in the presence of light,\nIrinid's light pushed out the darkness of the dragons.
2536	When the great spirit kissed Courcle's Heart,
2537	the sound of a heartbeat started resounding throughout the land.
2538	Blood flowing out of the heart touched the land
2539	and the land of Iria\nstarted to breath again.
2540	The Elves and Giants, however, became greedy.
2541	They believed that by obtaining Courcle's Heart,\nthey would also become like the great spirit.
2542	Thus, a foolish war between the races began\nand lives were being slaughtered for a long time.
2543	The great spirit was greatly disappointed\nand hurt by the betrayal.
2544	For the first time, the great spirit\nregretted all that she had done in Iria.
2545	The wrath of the great spirit\ncaused the relics of light to disappear, as if they were just mirages
2546	and the land was branded with a curse that could not be undone.
2547	The green prairies of Connous turned into barren deserts
2548	and the paralyzing snow storms tormented the Giants who suffered from hunger.
2549	Ultimately, the great spirit left Iria\nand disappeared into the western sea where the light had first glowed.
2550	Still, the great spirit left a promise.
2551	A promise to return one day.\nThe promise of hope...

2642	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nA world without pain or suffering is at hand.<br/>I am going to summon forth that world.
2643	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nWould you forsake that paradise?<br/>Would you give up on Tir Na Nog?<br/>All for some worthless human emotions?
2644	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI finally understand.
2645	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThe pain from my past... <br/>Even my hopes for the future...<br/>They are nothing compared <br/>with the truth I must defend now!
2646	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nFoolish human...<br/>You are blinded by a fleeting illusion.
2647	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nYou will regret your decision.
2648	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nTake care of the Brionac, <username/>.

2651	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nJenna!
2652	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThis is the final ritual for the purification of Tir Na Nog.<br/>Do not interfere!
2653	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nTell me! <br/>Just who is this Tir Na Nog meant for?<br/>What benefit does humanity get from calling forth Tir Na Nog?
2654	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nNo. To protect what is most precious to me,<br/>I will stand against the Goddess.
2655	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nFoolish human.<br/>You are so weak,<br/>and yet you attempt to show such valor.
2656	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nCichol, the Milletian has the power of Neamhain<br/>and now your power, too.<br/>The Milletian is beyond the<br/>boundary of our control.
2657	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe time has come to return to our beginning<br/>and consider Tir Na Nog.
2658	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nYes, the time has come.
2659	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nIt is time to return as the Goddesses of Badhbh<br/>to wield our swords once again...

2673	I command you, in the name the Bar Owner, stop!
2674	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nOoo--oh! Stop! Please...<br/>Leave me alone.
2675	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nI just came to have a good time with some girl. <br/>Why are you doing this to me?
2676	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nYou want money? How much do you want?<br/>This is all I've got. Take it, take it! <br/>Just leave me alone!
2677	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nMoney cannot mend a broken heart...
2678	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nSo this is the type of person you are, Lucas...
2679	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nYou're worthless. <br/>Now that I've seen what kind of lowlife scum you are,<br/>there is no need for me to deal with you any longer.
2680	Huh? What's this?
2681	Aaaaack...
2682	Do you remember, Leymore?
2683	Our first meeting, under the stars in Emain Macha.
2684	The night was filled with despair\nand you were my only source of light.
2685	I've discovered the truth.
2686	My father didn't die at the hands of the Fomors.
2687	I didn't want to believe it, but it's true.
2688	The Royal Alchemists were responsible for this death.
2689	Leymore, I don't blame you...
2690	My father may have been just a political scapegoat.
2691	But Leymore, you're a Royal Alchemist with the Aliech Regime.
2692	I'm so confused.
2693	Please understand why I can't be with you.\n\n                               -Jenna-
2694	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nHelvetius?<br/>You're alive?
2695	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nDid you expect any less from me? Muhaha...
2696	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nI'm surprised to see that you've survived,<br/>even after learning the truth.
2697	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nWhat drove you to survive?<br/>Revenge?
2698	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThere is still a truth that I seek.
2699	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nTruth you say?<br/>Muahaha! <br/>It was in chasing after the truth of the Parthalonians<br/>that your father gave up his life.
2700	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nNo, perhaps he paid an even heftier price than death.
2701	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThis isn't the end.
2702	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nOh, but it is the end, Jenna.<br/>I've already accomplished my first goal,<br/>separating you from Leymore.
2703	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nAll that is left now is for you to take your leave...
2704	<npcportrait name='hallalchemist'/><title name='Helvetius'/>\nWho are you?!
2705	Arat Diem Morri Daunata...
2706	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nA human hanging on for dear life <br/>with nothing but despair as company. <br/>How sad.
2707	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nHow cruel, yes, but fascinating at the same time.
2708	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI know about Elatha's death.
2709	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nYou've lost your child, your only bloodline<br/>yet I don’t sense even the slightest hint of sadness from you.
2710	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nIs that because you're a Goddess?
2711	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI am not here as a deity.<br/>I can speak of light, even in the midst of darkness,<br/>because I, young one, still have a dream.
2712	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI have come before you because I sense the darkness within you.
2713	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nEverything I've believed in my entire life <br/>has been buried in darkness...
2714	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI'm...confused. <br/>I can't tell what's true anymore!
2715	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nYou've seen the darkness! <br/>You understand how blinding it is. If suffocates me...
2716	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nGoddess, help me escape this darkness. Please!
2717	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nEvery action has its consequence.<br/>Your fate is no different.<br/>Come, follow me.
2718	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nI shall share with you the dream of Tir Na Nog<br/>where your tears will be no more.
2719	<npcportrait name='neamhain'/><title name='Neamhain'/>\nThe sadness and despair of this world shall become but a distant memory.
2720	Python Shaman
2721	Tir Na Nog will be purified...      \n
2722	\n\n              ...by the light of the Caliburn, transformed as the Brionac...
2723	To protect what is most precious to me,
2724	\n\n                   I will stand against the Goddess.
2725	I give you the power of Cichol.
2726	\n\n\nYou now possess the power of the Fomors. A power of strength,\n                from the spirit of darkness... Which will lead to a brilliant annihilation.
2727	Spirits of Partholon, by the light of the Caliburn,

2734	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>But, Cai... I doubt that this is the end of it.<br/>What we've discovered from this incident<br/>is that the Fomors are not the only ones <br/>threatening peace in Shadow Realm.
2735	<npcportrait name=''/><title name='<username/>'/>The Royal Alchemists need you. <br/>Please re-join them...
2736	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>I've given a lot of thought to that issue.<br/>I may have chosen not to take the road of a Royal Alchemist,<br/>but that doesn't mean that I don't want defend the Shadow Realm....
2737	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>You know, <username/>, I think you may be right.<br/>We can't stand against enemies if we're not united.
2738	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>Yes, I think, given another chance, <br/>I would choose to re-join the Royal Alchemists.

2775	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nWhat an incredible coincidence! <br/>I was just thinking how much I'd enjoy publishing <br/>a collection of stories about the Shadow Hero <br/>who defeated Claimh Solas.
2776	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nSo, you interested?
2777	<title name='<username/>'/>\nSure! I mean, no. I mean, we have more important things to discuss!<br/>What were you doing in a place like this all by yourself?
2778	<title name='<username/>'/>\nThe Shadow Realm is not safe.
2779	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nSo, is that a no on the book? Eh, I've got time. <br/>Let me know if you change your mind...
2780	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nAs for what I'm doing here, use your head! <br/>I came to the Shadow Realm in search of ancient books!
2781	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nI got a tip that books written by the ancient Parthalonians<br/>were being discovered in the Royal Castle Shadow Realm.<br/>Of course I had to come and see for myself.
2782	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nI found some interesting stuff, too. Here, in this book.<br/>I think you'd want to see this.
2783	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nSince you're the Shadow Hero and all, <br/>I figured you'd be interested.
2784	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nYou must've heard of the Caliburn before,<br/>a treasure that disappeared from the Rath Royal Castle.<br/>This ancient Parthalonian book I found in the Shadow Realm<br/>contains information about the it.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ3_2' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2785	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nI need to decipher more of the ancient Parthalonian language <br/>to understand the details though...
2786	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nIsn't the fact that the Caliburn came from a civilization <br/>much more advanced than us Tuatha de Dananns<br/>a great discovery in itself?
2787	<npcportrait name='buchanan'/><title name='Buchanan'/>\nHmm. The Parthalonian race and the Caliburn...<br/>There is definitely something here.<br/>Further investigation may yield a great treasure...
2788	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI've come on behalf of the Goddess of Light<br/>to take the Brionac.

2851	<username/>!
2852	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI've come on behalf of the Goddess of Light<br/>to take the Brionac.
2853	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nSpirit of Water.<br/>Please give me the Brionac.
2854	<npcportrait name='aer'/><title name='Aer'/>\nThe fragments of the Caliburn,<br/>which were separated into two worlds,<br/>have finally become one.
2855	<npcportrait name='aer'/><title name='Aer'/>\nHere, the Brionac, which was once the Caliburn.
2856	<npcportrait name='aer'/><title name='Aer'/>\nI was merely safeguarding the Brionac.<br/>A mere spirit like me dare not touch it.
2857	<npcportrait name='aer'/><title name='Aer'/>\nBut Jenna, please remember that the Caliburn <br/>is also called the light of the dark sun.
2858	<npcportrait name='aer'/><title name='Aer'/>\nTake that as a warning.<br/>You may one day be covered in the darkness of the dark sun...
2859	<title name='<username/>'/>\nNo! You mustn't give the Brionac to Neamhain!
2860	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nThe Brionac represents not just my will,<br/>but the will of Neamhain, the Goddess of Light,<br/>to bring forth Tir Na Nog.
2861	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nIt's no use.
2862	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nStand in my way, <br/>and I'll have no choice but to use my sword on you, <username/>.

2864	<title name='<username/>'/>\nCichol?
2865	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nCichol, you know better than anyone <br/>that the Brionac was used to destroy the Gods.

2867	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nDid you learn that from Neamhain?<br/>Then you must also know the details<br/>of the Goddesses' dreams for Tir Na Nog.
2868	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nAnd how that dream will turn into a nightmare...
2869	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nNeamhain has become so fixated on her own agenda<br/>that she fails to see the devastation the Brionac will bring.
2870	<npcportrait name='cichol'/><title name='Cichol'/>\nNo. The Brionac will not bring about the beginning of Tir Na Nog.<br/>Rather, it will usher in its annihilation!
2871	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nI don't know what you're talking about, Cichol.
2872	<npcportrait name='jenna'/><title name='Jenna'/>\nAll I know is that a God will soon die, <br/> right before my eyes.

2884	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nSo we meet again, Milletian.<br/>Has the scent of the ancient Parthalonians <br/>brought you here as well?
2885	<title name='<username/>'/>\nMata!!
2886	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nI can't sit idly by while the Caliburn fall into the hands of a Milletian.<br/>The Caliburn always belonged to the Fomors.
2887	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nEven Chicol, the King of the Fomors, warned of the devastation that Erinn could face.<br/>This danger applies to Human and Fomor alike!
2888	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nSilence!<br/>Cichol is no longer our king.
2889	<npcportrait name='mata'/><title name='Mata'/>\nHe is nothing but a coward who has forsaken the Fomor ideal.

2895	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nIdentify yourself.
2896	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nYou are neither Human nor Fomor...<br/>What are you?!
2897	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nI belong in the boundary between light and shadow.<br/>That is all you need to know for now.
2898	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nThe Gods are a race with greed that stretches as long as their endless lives.<br/>You seem to have inherited their vile powers.
2899	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nDo you wish to become a God yourself?<br/>Or do you merely wish for human power?
2900	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nTime will tell...
2901	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nYou may simply become a monster, neither Human nor God...
2902	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\n<username/>, I will entrust the pages of the Parthalonians to you.
2903	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nI will be watching you.<br/>We will meet again in the near future.
2904	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nThis doesn't bode well.<br/>The Fomors acted as the usually act...
2905	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nBut I'm worried about the Python Knight.<br/>Who is he?
2906	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nI think I'll investigate the Python Knight and find out what I can...
2907	<npcportrait name='cai'/><title name='Cai'/>\nLeymore, <username/>. <br/>Please continue investigating Parthalonian magic.
2908	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nOooh... Find your perfect partner. <br/>Blondes, brunettes, redheads!<br/>Whatever your preference, we've got the perfect match.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ8_5' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>

2912	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nHow could I possibly remember something that happened seven years ago...
2913	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nSeven years ago...<br/>You destroyed the<br/>innocence of a young girl!
2914	<npcportrait name='lucas'/><title name='Lucas'/>\nWha--what are you talking about?<br/>Are you sure?
2915	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nThe girl was named Belita.

2918	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nLiar...
2919	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nYour lies are what made that girl come back for revenge...
2920	<title name='Anonymous'/>\nI will execute her revenge in her stead!
2921	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nI didn't think that you would be able to use Alchemy to<br/>recreate the ancient Parthalonian magic so perfectly.<br/>Better than I could have hoped for.
2922	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nBut you must hurry.<br/>I'm worried about Neamhain's plans for the Brionac.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ8_1' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2923	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nNeamhain's plans? Are you saying that Neamhain is up to something again?
2924	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI thought Neamhain<br/>gave up on her dreams<br/>after Elatha's death.
2925	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nElatha's death has only made Neamhain's will stronger.<br/>Neamhain will try to complete her dream of Tir Na Nog<br/>for no other reason than that Elatha's death<br/>will not have been in vain.
2926	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nBut the ideals of Tir Na Nog that Neamhain envisions is not the truth. <br/>Her dreams will only bring about death and destruction.
2927	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThe Caliburn has already been given to Aer, the Spirit of Water, <br/>and has evolved to the Brionac, the holy sword.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ8_3' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2928	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nNeamhain will do anything to get her hands on the Brionac.
2929	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nIf we can't stop Neamhain, <br/>there's no telling what the future holds...
2930	<npcportrait name='morrighan'/><title name='Morrighan'/>\nThere's no time to delay.
2931	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI've been waiting for you.<br/>I was worried.
2932	<title name='<username/>'/>\nLeymore, what about Jenna?<br/>Did you find her?
2933	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\nI think I may know where she is.<br/>But I have bad feeling about this.<br/>The Erg energy in the Shadow Realm<br/>is very unstable right now.
2934	<npcportrait name='leymore'/><title name='Leymore'/>\n<username/>, I'm going to need your help.<br/>Please help me find Jenna.
2935	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nI promised we'd meet again.<br/><username/>, you've acted exactly as I expected.
2936	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nI got rid of those pesky Gods easily, thanks to you.
2937	<title name='<username/>'/>\nWhat are you talking about?
2938	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nThe disappearance of the Caliburn, <br/>the creation of the Shadow Realm,<br/>the activities of the Gods,<br/>and the final transformation of the Caliburn into the Brionac.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ10_32' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2939	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nEven the death of Cichol...
2940	<npcportrait name='shadowknight_mask'/><title name='Python Knight'/>\nI, Tuan, Prince of the Parthalonians, <br/>planned all of that!
2941	<title name='<username/>'/>\nPrince of the Parthalonians?<br/>Then you are the lone survivor <br/>of the Parthalonian race!
2942	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nFor thousands of years, I've waited,<br/>consumed by a single thought...<br/>To take revenge on the Gods<br/>who destroyed my race.<image name='G11_S1_SEQ10_2' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2943	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nThough my body, encased in this shell of suffering, cries in pain...
2944	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nI never gave up the hope<br/>of reviving my race.

2946	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nThough the Parthalonians were wiped out by the Gods,<br/>we will be raised by their own sword!<br/>We will aim the Brionac back at their hearts.
2947	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\n<username/>, you have done your part.<br/>Hand the Brionac to me.<br/>I am Tuan mac  Cairill, the Prince of the Parthalonians,<br/>and the rightful owner of the Caliburn.
2948	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nNow that Cichol is gone,<br/>none shall stand in my way.
2949	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nI was careless. <br/>I did not think that you would <br/>inherit the abilities of a demon. <br/>I have been defeated by Cichol's cunning...
2950	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\n<username/>, you may have been granted <br/>a power like those of the Gods, <br/>but one day, you will regret <br/>having received such power...
2951	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nRemember the downfall of the Parthalonians.<br/>Morrighan, fearful of the power of the Parthalonians,<br/>used Cichol to annihilate our race.
2952	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nBut Morrighan's selfishness did not end there....<br/>She then grew fearful of the Fomors<br/>and brought you Milletians into Erinn.<br/>You have seen the tragic death of Cichol.
2953	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nDoes Cichol's fate<br/>not seem familiar to you?
2954	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nDo you still not understand that the Goddess<br/>is simply using you Milletians to accomplish her desires? <br/>What happens when she grows fearful of YOU?<image name='G11_S1_SEQ9_2' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>
2955	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nYou must know the truth.
2956	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nWill the selfish Goddess permit the Milletians<br/>to grow in power and challenge the authority of the Gods?
2957	<npcportrait name='shadowknight'/><title name='Tuan'/>\nThis is not the end of the Parthalonians.<br/>The Altar of Caliburn<br/>will not be given up so easily!<image name='G11_S1_SEQ9_1' width='512' height='512'Y='30' cutscene='true'/>

2966	The power of the Brionac has been transferred to Nuadha.\nThe incomplete light of the Caliburn
2967	can neither open the gates to Falias\nnor awaken the abilities of Badhbh\nreceived from Morrighan.
2968	From the beginning, "Brionac"\nwas another name for Falias.
2969	The Aura of Falias is required\n to restore the lost Brionac.
2970	The fragments of Falias scattered throughout Erinn\nare known as the treasures of the Gods.
2971	Please collect these fragments\nand refill the power of the Brionac that has disappeared.

3171	Chapter 1 Appetizer
3172	Thirty years ago...
3173	Hey! My name's Glewyas.\nMy dream is to become Erinn's greatest Cooking Master.
3174	Starting today, I'm on a journey to become a Cooking Master.
3175	Who's that cat, you ask? I call her Cinnamon.
3176	Oh no! What happened here?!
3177	Who would do such a thing? Are you okay?
3178	Only a person with great skills could have done this. Meow.
3179	This is terrible. Meow...\nThis could only have been the work of the\nlegendary Master Pasta...
3180	The cat's right... \nThis is the work of the Shadow Chef...! *Cough*
3181	I never thought that I would\nsee the legendary Master Pasta with my own eyes...
3182	The Shadow Chef is poisoning everyone with his shadow culinary skills.
3183	At this rate, the whole town...no, all of Erinn will be under the Shadow Chef's control!
3184	Master Pasta... Can you even imagine?
3185	Please... I beg of you... You must stop the Shadow Chef.
3186	Please protect the people... protect Erinn.... Ugh...
3187	Blast that Shadow Chef. I won't let him get away with this!
3188	To be continued...
3189	Glewyas Chronicles
3190	Chapter 3 Dessert
3191	Heh, it's too soon to be happy. \nYour chef may know a few tricks...
3192	...but you'd be mistaken to think that Master Pasta is the Shadow Chef's best skill.
3193	Master Chef has yet to use even 10% of his strength.
3194	You mean...?!
3195	Muahaha, do you think that using that pot\nwill allow you to catch up to my cooking?
3196	I will show no mercy!
3197	Salsa King! 
3198	Oh no, has he started?
3199	The feared dish, named for its noodles that resemble\nthe passionate movements of salsa dancers...
3200	It's the Salsa King!
3201	Ooopmh!
3202	I can't move...
3203	The Salsa King? I've never even heard of such a thing before...
3204	This skill makes my body feel like dancing \nto the rhythm of the salsa...
3205	I don't think I can win against the Shadow Chef...
3206	Please protect Erinn...
3207	You're amazing, Chef!
3208	I know you can do it! Meow.
3209	Yes... For my friends...
3210	I can't back down now!
3211	What?! How can he get up after the Salsa King?!\nIs he in his right mind?
3212	It's my turn now! Take this Shadow Chef!
3213	Glewyas's ultimate skill!
3214	Romantic Punch Pasta!!
3215	Noooo!
3216	Yesss!
3217	Ugh...
3218	How could I lose to such a novice...
3219	Hehe.... You should've studied Glewyas's Mythril Chef Recipe Book.

3229	Eek!
3230	How dare you challenge me...?
3231	Say your last prayer!
3232	Stop!
3233	Stop picking on the weak!
3234	Shall we cook?!
3235	Who are you?\nThis is no place for a novice!
3236	I'll have to teach you a lesson!
3237	Master Pasta!
3238	Boooom!
3239	Ugh! He got me. It feels as if my stomach will explode. Could it be...indigestion?
3240	Ahhh... What an amazing skill...
3241	What? He figured out the skill after just one hit!
3242	How can he still be standing after tasting my Master Pasta?!
3243	Hmm.... Just as I figured... This isn't going to be easy.
3244	I will have to concentrate and cook from the heart.
3245	My teacher told me to never wield this\nunless I am making a dish that will save the world but...
3246	I think I will need to make an exception...
3247	What? You were carrying that big pot on you this whole time?
3248	You're amazing, Chef!
3249	Heh, it's too soon to be happy. \nYour chef may know a few tricks...
3250	...but you'd be mistaken to think that Master Pasta is the Shadow Chef's best skill.
3251	You mean...?!

4484	-Friend-\nI can't believe you broke our promise! How could you?
4485	-Woman-\nYou are the one who broke our promise first.
4486	-Friend-\nYou shouldn't have done it... You of all people should have protected...
4487	-Woman-\nI had no choice. That was the only way to stop you.
4488	-Friend-\nNo...because of this, you've turned me into an unstoppable monster.
4489	-Woman-\nWhat?!
4490	-Friend-\nYou...never listen to my requests.
4491	-Woman-\nPlease, come back to us.
4492	-Friend-\n\nToday is the last day...\nThat we will call each other friends.
4493	Morrighan...
4494	-Friend-\nIt is done! So, this day actually came. Wait! There is one more left.
4495	-Young Woman-\nWhat's left? I didn't leave out anything.
4496	-Friend-\nWe have to close it so one can come over.

4500	-Friend-\nWhat do you mean by let it slide like you do?

4502	-Friend-\nIt's not giving up... I'm trying to make a weak world stronger.
4503	-Young Woman-\nPlease don't... Watching you change scares me.
4504	-Friend-\nThe hole is getting bigger. We must tell everyone.
4505	-Girl-\nNo! Then people might make the hole disappear.
4506	-Friend-\nWhat if something really scary comes over?
4507	-Girl-\nDon't worry, we'll make a magical door then! The two of us are more than enough!
4508	-Friend-\nMagical door? That's too dangerous.
4509	-Girl-\nLook at this place. Can you really say that?

4513	-Girl-\nOkay!
4514	-Friend-\nHey, in the sky.
4515	-Little Girl-\nHmm?
4516	-Friend-\nThere is a hole in the sky.

5133	I have something to report.
5134	The seed has finally sprouted.
5135	Uh-oh. They're already guarding it.\nYou must be careful of those in black.\nThey're fearsome.
5136	Everything else will fall into place as long as you\nmanage to get in. You just have to follow the path.
5137	You'll start seeing ore when you go deep.\nYou just thought those were all jewels, right?\nRemember, you must leave those glittering things be!
5138	If you rummage through the mined ore,\nyou'll find something blacker than black.\nThat's what you must bring to me.
5139	I'd rather not waste my breath.\nCan you see it?\nYou must be wondering what this place is, right?
5140	Your eyes might hurt, but I'm sure you'll enjoy exploring the town.\nThough that's not important here...
5141	Right over there! That thing right there is what I've been talking about.\nI'm sure you'll figure out a way to bring it back.

5360	<title name='Woman'/>We can't do this anymore.<p/>
5361	<title name='Man'/>Please, try a bit harder, darling.<p/>
5362	<title name='Woman'/>No. I will be nothing more than a burden on you if I go.<p/>\n					<title name='Woman'/>I will stop them here.<br/>You must leave this place now.<p/>\n					<title name='Woman'/>With our child...<p/>
5363	<title name='Man'/>No, I will stay here with you!<p/>\n					<title name='Man'/>Please don't give up. Please...<p/>
5364	<title name='Woman'/>Dear...<p/>\n					<title name='Woman'/>We can't leave our child all alone.<p/>
5365	<title name='Woman'/>Take this.<p/>\n					<title name='Woman'/>My brother will recognize this necklace.<p/>

5372	Soul Stream
5373	<title name='Nao'/>Wake up.<br/>Can you hear me?<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>You must be aware of the strange phenomenon<br/>that the Milletians have been experiencing lately, right?<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>Yes, the polluted Soul Stream is the cause.<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>All of the Milletian souls are being polluted as well.<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>I tried my best to stop this from happening...<br/>But I was caught off-guard.<p/>
5374	<title name='Nao'/>Well, this thing...<br/>It grows out of the evil side of Milletian nature,<br/>so I can't get rid of it entirely.<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>It will only disappear when the Soul Stream is destroyed.<br/>And that is another matter entirely.<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>Besides, the gods and goddesses who are capable<br/>of such acts won't help us with them.<p/>
5375	<title name='Nao'/>Not much time is left now.<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>Please...<br/>Make the right choice...<p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>And if you can...<br/>Save my old friends who have fallen into evil ways...<br/><p/>\n					<title name='Nao'/>Please, I beg of you...<p/>

5379	Raspa Volcano Region
5380	<title name='Black Mask'/>Blast it!<p/>\n					<title name='Black Mask'/>I know I felt a divine power from that explosion.<br/>Did they interfere in our work again?!<p/>
5381	<title name='Black Mask'/>This is becoming intolerable...<p/>\n					<title name='Black Mask'/>Are they trying to take the rest of my comrades away from me?<br/>Are they not satisfied with ruining the lives of everyone I've ever loved?!<p/>
5382	<title name='Black Mask'/>Heart!<p/>
5383	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Yes, sir.<p/>
5384	<title name='Black Mask'/>I'm going to find a medium for the manifestation of the goddess.<p/>\n					<title name='Black Mask'/>If the gods and goddesses cherish it so dearly,<br/>I have to destroy it with a power that's as divine as their own.<p/>
5385	<title name='Black Mask'/><npcportrait name='BlackMask'/>Our forces are greatly weakened at this point.<p/>\n					<title name='Black Mask'/><npcportrait name='BlackMask'/>I'll put you in charge of our reprisal.<p/>\n					<title name='Black Mask'/><npcportrait name='BlackMask'/>You may use...the item.<p/>

5387	Longa Desert
5388	<title name='Ruairi'/>Are there really heroes left in this world?<p/>
5389	<title name='Millia'/>My dad told me that heroes don't exist.<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>He said that if there were real heroes,<br/>my mom wouldn't have been killed by that monster...<p/>
5390	<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>
5391	<title name='Millia'/>No one was there to help us when the demons attacked Cor.<br/>When they attacked my dad...<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>Or when my teacher...<p/>
5392	<title name='Millia'/>You know, if you didn't save me when I fell<br/>from the ruin in Karu Forest, I would have died. <p/>
5393	<title name='Millia'/>In my opinion...<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>If you can help someone in need, then you're a hero.<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>You protected me when I was in a danger.<br/>So you're my hero.<p/>
5394	<title name='Ruairi'/>Someone who protects others...<p/>
5395	<title name='Millia'/>I have a wish.<p/>
5396	<title name='Ruairi'/>Wish?<p/>
5397	<title name='Millia'/>Yes. I want to find the murderer who killed my parents and take my revenge.<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>I'm going to tell him how much I've suffered...<br/>All the pain and loneliness...<br/>I'm going to tell him everything.<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>I'm going to tell him how much my dad suffered<br/>and how much my mom struggled in pain because of him.<br/>I'm going to tell him...<p/>
5398	<title name='Millia'/>Mister, please help me.<p/>
5399	<title name='Ruairi'/>I know how heartbreaking it is to lose your family.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Revenge was the only thing that kept me going...<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>
5400	<title name='Ruairi'/>Fine.<br/>I'll help you with your revenge.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>If you need me in those final moments, I'll be your sword.<p/>
5401	Vales
5402	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Why you, of all people?<p/>\n					<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Hmph, not that it matters.<br/>Your time is short. We needn't fight here.<p/>
5403	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Cessair! Retreat!<p/>
5404	Longa Desert
5405	<title name='Elder Shaman'/>Hmm? What a strange feeling.<br/>Say, he looks oddly familiar...<p/>
5406	<title name='Shaman'/>I also find him familiar...<br/>Well, we should treat him first.<p/>
5407	<title name='Ruairi'/>!<p/>
5408	<title name='Ruairi'/>You... Did you try to kill me?<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>How could you do this to me?!<br/>I even took the oath for you!<p/>
5409	<title name='Shaman'/>I knew it!<p/>
5410	<title name='Elder Shaman'/>W-were you the Black Devil?!<p/>
5411	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tarlach.<p/>
5412	<title name='Tarlach'/>Are you okay?!<br/>Oh, I'm so happy to see you alive...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I thought for sure you were dead.<p/>
5413	<title name='Tarlach'/>I've found the medium for the goddess.<br/>You can finally have your revenge.<p/>
5414	<title name='Tarlach'/>Did you do that?<p/>
5415	<title name='Ruairi'/>Yeah.<p/>
5416	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<br/>And you're okay with it?<p/>
5417	<title name='Ruairi'/>She tried to hand me over to the shamans.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Now...<br/>I couldn't care less about her.<p/>
5418	<title name='Ruairi'/>Wait... Did you say that she's a medium for the goddess's manifestation?<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Huh. She'll be the perfect offering.<p/>
5419	<title name='Milletian'/>Hello, we're here on the set of The Saga: Iria.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>I'm the 7th year Milletian, and I'll be your host.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>You may remember me from my brief appearance in episode 6. Right? Right?<p/>
5420	<title name='Milletian'/>Joining me today is the whole cast. Ruairi, Tarlach, Akule, Millia,<br/>Shamala, Maike, and Dowra.<p/>
5421	<title name='Milletian'/>Hello everybody.<p/>
5422	<title name='Everybody'/>Hello.<p/>
5423	<title name='Milletian'/>Normally in a drama commentary,<br/>the actors come out and talk about the show.<br/>But we're going to do this like a Q&&A.<p/>
5424	<title name='Millia'/>What, really? We're not even doing a normal commentary?<p/>
5425	<title name='Milletian'/>That's right, Millia.<br/>What we're doing is BETTER.<p/>
5426	<title name='Milletian'/>Here's your first question.<br/>A lot of people on the development team were asking about this as well.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Ruairi, how'd you age all of a sudden?<br/>And where did you get the awesome beard?<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>I thought the Tuatha de Danann weren't suppose to age that rapidly.<p/>
5427	<title name='Ruairi'/>Ahahaha... Yes the beard. I knew you would ask about it.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>It does seem awkward, doesn't it? I mean, even I find it awkward.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>You do seem to know a lot about Tuatha de Danann.<br/>I suppose you ARE a Milletian.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Yes, as you say Tuatha de Danann don't age like Milletians do.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>But it was different in my case.<p/>
5428	<title name='Milletian'/>Can you explain a little?<p/>
5429	<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>After I made up my mind to destroy the world of gods,<br/>I realized that the thing that I needed the most to accomplish this was power.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>It is a near impossible feat<br/>for a human to destroy the world of gods...<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>So, I started looking for power that could rival that of the gods.<br/>And my search led me to the Soul Stream.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>The Soul Stream is something that all Milletians pass through.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>The Milletian nature, characteristics, emotions and life...<br/>Every aspect of their lives is contained within.<p/>
5430	<title name='Ruairi'/>Even you.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Of all that information on Milletians,<br/>I was able to isolate the evil nature and accept it into my body.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>So, my aging was more of a side effect.<br/>The timing, or aging aspects of a Milletian must have been applied to me.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>It was a small price to pay for the power that I was to obtain.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Until the day that the gods are destroyed...<p/>
5431	<title name='Milletian'/>So the beard is part of the side affects?<p/>
5432	<title name='Ruairi'/>Ha! Correct.<br/>Since I am influenced by the same flow of time as you, my body ages like yours.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I sometimes get the urge to shave it off,<br/>but it will just grow back soon after anyway.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>It would be a waste of time.<p/>
5433	<title name='Milletian'/>Do you have plans to shave it off in the future?<p/>
5434	<title name='Ruairi'/>No comment.<p/>
5435	<title name='Milletian'/>Well, aren't you a man of secrets?<p/>
5436	<title name='Milletian'/>Moving on to the next question!<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>This one is for Millia.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Are you ever going to learn some manners?<p/>
5437	<title name='Millia'/>Wh-what?! What kind of question is that?<p/>
5438	<title name='Milletian'/>Well, to be honest, Millia, your attitude during the Saga was not the best.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Some people felt you were selfish and self-centered,<br/>while others considered you rude and overbearing...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Just thinking about it makes me mad.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>What is your problem, anyway?<p/>
5439	<title name='Millia'/>What do you want from me?<br/>It's not like I have any role models to learn from!<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>I mean, I love my Teacher...<br/>But have you ever REALLY listened to the things he says?<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>And then we thought he was dead and I got<br/>stuck with the beast girl. She was raised by animals!<p/>\n					<title name='Millia'/>I had a hard enough time just trying to survive!<p/>
5440	<title name='Milletian'/>Hmm... You do have a point there, I guess...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>But you took out most of your aggression on us Milletians!<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>You should be at least a little be more grateful. Hmph.<p/>
5441	<title name='Milletian'/>Next question.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>A lot of people were surprised when you made your appearance, Tarlach.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Were you surprised when Ruairi appeared out of nowhere?<p/>
5442	<title name='Tarlach'/>Oh, of course.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Who wouldn't be surprised if a friend that you thought was long dead suddenly shows up out of nowhere?<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I'm still startled every time I see an older guy with facial hair.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Though my face has started to age a little as well.<p/>
5443	<title name='Milletian'/>Is your aging also part of the side effects?<p/>
5444	<title name='Tarlach'/>Yes. <p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I am using the same power that Ruairi is using.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>But thanks to that I have stopped transforming at night,<br/>and Sidhe Sneachta's limitations on me are broken.<p/>
5445	<title name='Milletian'/>So does that mean you can no longer transform into a bear?<p/>
5446	<title name='Tarlach'/>I could if I wanted to, but I don't.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It is not as fun as it sounds.<p/>
5447	<title name='Milletian'/>I see.<p/>
5448	<title name='Milletian'/>Next, we have a question for Miss Shamala.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>You seem to say Grrr a lot. Is that a habit?<p/>
5449	<title name='Shamala'/>Yes.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>My mother, the Black Leopard that raised me, used to make that noise a lot.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>I must have picked it up from her.<p/>
5450	<title name='Milletian'/>Also sometimes your expressions seem very awkward.<p/>
5451	<title name='Shamala'/>I've been trying to learn human language, but it is hard.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>Words are hard, and accents are very difficult to deal with.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>I do my best, but sometimes things come out wrong.<p/>
5452	<title name='Milletian'/>You must be misunderstood a lot.<p/>
5453	<title name='Shamala'/>Yes. I think one of the reasons why people don't like me is because of the way I speak.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>What can you do about it?<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>Only thing I can do is work on it.<p/>\n					<title name='Shamala'/>Might take a long time though. Grr.<p/>
5454	<title name='Milletian'/>That must be tough...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>But you can do it!<p/>
5455	<title name='Milletian'/>Next up, we'll talk to the most popular character, Akule!<p/>
5456	<title name='Akule'/>Oh goodness! Is it my turn already?<p/>
5457	<title name='Milletian'/>You were so popular with your strange, impulsive way of speaking.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Where does all that come from?<p/>
5458	<title name='Akule'/>Well, I do try to keep up with the latest trends and fashions.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>It might be because every week I read 'Cor Village People' magazine.<p/>
5459	<title name='Milletian'/>Huh? There's a 'Cor Village People' magazine? I've never heard of it.<p/>
5460	<title name='Akule'/>Ha! Of course you haven't!<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>It's my own personal publication. I've just never published it.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>Chief Kousai is very hard to convince at times.<p/>
5461	<title name='Milletian'/>Uh...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Moving on, there was a lot of talk when you appeared as Lelach.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Some thought you had a multiple-personality disorder,<br/>others said that you were only normal when you had your mask on...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>So, what's the deal?<p/>
5462	<title name='Akule'/>I knew my acting was great!<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>If acting was a skill in this world I would have maxed out my level!<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>I'm sorry to crush the hopes of all the theorists, but I'm just a darn fine actor.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>I mean, even my fellow Shamans didn't know it was an act!<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>Here is a little secret just for you.<br/>Right now I'm wearing the best mask of them all, the Glass Mask.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>I can become whoever I want with it!<p/>
5463	<title name='Millia'/>Uh, teacher...<p/>
5464	<title name='Milletian'/>So, what's the deal with your masks?<p/>
5465	<title name='Akule'/>Oh those? They're a hobby of mine.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>I collect masks, you see.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>I probably have over a hundred of them.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>Which one I wear usually depends on how I'm feeling that day.<br/>Lately I've been favoring the eagle mask and the monkey mask a lot.<p/>\n					<title name='Akule'/>That reminds me, I should go see if there are any new ones that I can buy...<p/>
5466	<title name='Milletian'/>I would love to get to see your collection<br/>whenever we have the chance...<p/>
5467	<title name='Milletian'/>Okay, on to the final questions!<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>These are for Dowra and Maike!<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>These two have also been very popular lately.<p/>
5468	<title name='Milletian'/>First goes to you Dowra!<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>We understand that you are supposed to be older than Kirine,<br/>but you look much younger than her. What is your secret?<p/>
5469	<title name='Dowra'/>Oh really? I look younger? Ha!<p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>Wow, that is a first.<p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>Well, there's not much to it, really.<p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>Eat well, sleep well, and fight all the time!<p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>Even when there are no foes around, I try to spar with my troops.<p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>Nothing beats a good beatdown.<p/>
5470	<title name='Milletian'/>That sounds like a powerful secret.<p/>
5471	<title name='Milletian'/>And now a question for the scary-eyed Maike.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Maike, you're known to always be angry. <p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>But recently it made news when you smiled for Chief Castanea.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>What could have caused this?<p/>
5472	<title name='Maike'/>I respect Castanea.<br/>Must there be any greater reason?<p/>
5473	<title name='Milletian'/>We still think there might be more to this.<p/>
5474	<title name='Maike'/>We are like-minded<br/>in that we both despise Giants.<p/>
5475	<title name='Milletian'/>So what you are saying here is,<br/>you would smile for anybody<br/>who doesn't like giants?<p/>
5476	<title name='Maike'/>...So many tiresome questions.<p/>\n					<title name='Maike'/>Please excuse me. <p/>\n					<title name='Maike'/>The questions are one thing,<br/>but being forced to suffer the presence of Giants<br/>is quite another. I feel ill.<p/>
5477	<title name='Milletian'/>Wait, Maike! Maike!<p/>
5478	<title name='Milletian'/>Wow... Well, I guess we shouldn't be surprised.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>There you have it folks, that was the cold-hearted Maike.<p/>
5479	<title name='Dowra'/>Don't worry about him too much. <p/>\n					<title name='Dowra'/>He's been on edge lately.<p/>
5480	<title name='Milletian'/>I guess that is a little comforting.<p/>
5481	<title name='Milletian'/>Wow! Just look at the time.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>It's about time to wrap this Q&&A up.<p/>
5482	<title name='Milletian'/>I'm the 7th year Milletian, your host!  That's all, folks!<p/>
5483	<title name='Milletian'/>Let me give one last shoutout to those Milletian-hating Tuatha de Danann.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>You should really think better of Milletians.<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>That's right. Heart to heart... That is the most important thing, to trust one another...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>Erinn isn't home to just you.<br/>There are other villages, other continents, other races...<p/>\n					<title name='Milletian'/>We're all in this together, gang!<p/>
5484	<title name='Cessair'/>We're done here. Come down from there now.<p/>
5485	<title name='Milletian'/>What? Wait! I still have more to say!<p/>
5486	Sidhe Sneachta
5487	<title name='Tarlach'/>Long ago, Mari, Ruairi, and I took off looking for paradise.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>But as if to mock our efforts, Paradise was right under our noses.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Erinn...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It was already paradise.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>A paradise spotted with chaos and hatred.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>What is it...<br/>That is keeping this world from being a true paradise?<p/>
5488	<title name='Tarlach'/>Why do the Formors<br/>and Tuatha de Danann hate each other so much?<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Why are the Milletians rejected by the Tuatha de Danann,<br/>even after providing so much help to them?<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Conflict may end if the gods end their meddling.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>But...is that really all?<p/>
5489	<title name='Tarlach'/>I might be able to work something out<br/>if I get a chance to examine the Relics from Iria.<br/>Some of them hold traces of the gods themselves.<p/><p/>
5490	<title name='Tarlach'/>The League of Explorers have brought in<br/>far more Relics than I expected.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Most of the stelae that are peddled in secret are from the Courcle region...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Sadly, I know nothing of their language.<p/>
5491	<title name='Tarlach'/>I managed to get some of the stelae from the Milletians.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I've started looking for the common factors between<br/>the words in the inscriptions.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>A bit more...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>If I make a bit more progress,<br/>I will probably be able to read the ancient words.<p/>
5492	Sidhe Sneachta
5493	<title name='Tarlach'/>What would that be?<br/>That's slightly different from magic.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It's power is very direct and wide-ranging...<br/>This is divine power.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>The power of the gods and goddesses that can<br/>twist space and weave time...<p/>
5494	<title name='Tarlach'/>A seal placed on Iria.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It almost looks like a microcosm of Erinn.<p/>
5495	<title name='Tarlach'/>I've started studying Alchemy so as to better<br/>understand the forces at work in this world.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It breaks my heart that I can no longer<br/>use magic in times like this.<p/>
5496	<title name='Tarlach'/>I've been working on my research.<br/>I found their version of magic to be very...interesting.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It may even be superior to our own...<p/>
5497	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ruairi?!<p/>
5498	<title name='Ruairi'/>How you've been?<p/>
5499	<title name='Tarlach'/>Is... is it really you?<br/>Ruairi! You're alive!<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I'm so happy to see you again...<p/>
5500	<title name='Tarlach'/>Where have you been?<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>After that day...<br/>You know, after the dragon took you away.<p/>
5501	<title name='Ruairi'/>I stayed in a place called Iria for a while.<br/>Then, I traveled across the sea to another continent.<p/>
5502	<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>
5503	<title name='Ruairi'/>I'm sure we both have a lot of stories to tell.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Let's spend some time today catching up.<p/>
5504	<title name='Tarlach'/>That's exactly what I had in mind.<p/
5505	Sidhe Sneachta
5506	It seems that Ruairi hasn't found much in his search for Triona.
5507	I've been analyzing the artifacts that Ruairi brought from Iria.
5508	I am now able to decipher the words on the stelae.
5509	Based on what I've read, there are special Charms hidden in Iria.
5510	They are extremely powerful relics that seem to contain\ndivine power in its purest form,\nyet they are created by humans.
5511	A Charm...
5512	Sidhe Sneachta
5513	<title name='Tarlach'/>Have you still not heard any news of her?<p/>
5514	<title name='Ruairi'/>It might be because she's a Fomor's child.<br/>It's really tough to find her.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I've been searching all day, and couldn't find a single lead.<p/>
5515	<title name='Tarlach'/>I'm sorry to hear that...<p/>
5516	<title name='Ruairi'/>Well, how is your work going?<p/>
5517	<title name='Tarlach'/>Good. I can read what's written on the stelae pretty well.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Oh, that reminds me...<p/>
5518	<title name='Ruairi'/>?<p/>
5519	<title name='Tarlach'/>I've heard there are special Charms in Iria.<br/>Could you bring me one when you have the chance?<p/>
5520	<title name='Ruairi'/>Charms?<p/>
5521	<title name='Tarlach'/>Yes. They're supposed to be relics containing divine power...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I might be able to free myself from this place<br/>with such power.<p/>
5522	<title name='Ruairi'/>Really? Okay. I'll be sure to bring you one.<p/>
5523	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ha, thank you.<p/>
5524	The Soul Stream is the most important connection in all of Erinn.
5525	It stops the flow of time by connecting this world to another world\nof pure space and time.\nIn this way, it keeps Erinn from being a true paradise.
5526	<title name='Tarlach'/>However, simply destroying the Soul Stream won't<br/>transform Erinn into a paradise.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>There are only two things that, together,<br/>can turn Erinn into a paradise.<p/>
5527	First, we must completely block the gods from intervening in this world's affairs.
5528	Second, we must purify people of their anger and hatred.\nThey cannot see that they already live in paradise\nbecause the gods cloud their minds with fear.
5529	<title name='Tarlach'/>The easiest way to achieve those two goals is<br/>to force the gods to undo their mistakes.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>However, they will never do such things.<p/>
5530	<title name='Tarlach'/>That leaves me with only one option.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I will take advantage of the Milletian,<br/>who is the master key created by the gods.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I will lay a curse on the Soul Stream<br/>to inflame the evil aspect of their nature<br/>and corrupt their souls.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I'll harvest this power to connect Erinn to the<br/>divine realm using Lia Fail.<br/>In the center of it all, I'll explode the corrupt power of the Milletians.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>That will destroy the Soul Stream and the<br/>world of the gods in a single strike.<p/>
5531	<title name='Tarlach'/>Milletian...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>If they are willing to support me,<br/>then my plan is foolproof.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>However, if he opposes me...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I'll have to resort to betrayal.<p/>
5532	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>So be it.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>If someone has to be the devil<br/>for the sake of the world...<p/>
5533	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I will accept that burden.<p/>
5534	Sidhe Sneachta
5535	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ruairi sent me a letter.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>It must be something serious, considering that it was written in such a rush.<p/>
5536	<title name='Tarlach'/>It seems Ruairi tried to locate Lugh Lavada,<br/>Triona's guardian, after hearing of his return.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>However, he soon learned that Lugh Lavada went mad<br/>and killed countless innocents.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Then he was killed by a Milletian named Shakespeare.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>With Lugh Lavada's death, Ruairi fell into despair.<br/>He had lost his last link to Triona.<p/>
5537	<title name='Tarlach'/>Lugh Lavada...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>He was the Knight of Light, but fell to darkness<br/>after willingly committing himself to the current of evil.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I can't believe that he went mad and died so pointlessly.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>He was not someone who would lose himself to madness.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Perhaps the gods tampered with his fate as well!<p/>
5538	<title name='Tarlach'/>Regardless, I've overcome the limits of mind and body.<br/>I've pushed past the dangers of physical and spiritual harm.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>And I want a bit more...<p/>
5539	Renes
5540	<title name='Ruairi'/>Stop chasing her.<p/>
5541	Sidhe Sneachta
5542	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tarlach.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I want to see her...<p/>
5543	<title name='Tarlach'/>You mean Triona?<p/>
5544	<title name='Ruairi'/>Yeah.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>If I knew this was going to happen,<br/>I wouldn't have parted with her like that.<p/>
5545	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
5546	<title name='Ruairi'/>My heart is filled with pointless regrets.<p/>
5547	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ruairi.<br/>Do you remember Lia Fail?<p/>
5548	<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>
5549	<title name='Tarlach'/>Lia Fail is modeled after the mythical Tree of Life.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>The Tree of Life is said to connect different realms to each other.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Also, this Tree of Life bears Golden Apples.<p/>
5550	<title name='Ruairi'/>Golden Apples?<p/>
5551	<title name='Tarlach'/>Yes...they are the source of life.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>If you take advantage of this apple...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>You might be able to bring Triona back.<p/>
5552	<title name='Ruairi'/>!<p/>
5553	<title name='Tarlach'/>Of course, we must study the Golden Apples to know for sure...<p/>
5554	<title name='Ruairi'/>Is the Golden Apple a part of your plan?<p/>
5555	<title name='Tarlach'/>The Golden Apple is not my goal.<br/>However, if we follow my plan, we can take them.<p/>
5556	<title name='Ruairi'/>...<p/>
5557	<title name='Ruairi'/>Is your offer still open?<p/>
5558	<title name='Tarlach'/>...Yes.<p/>
5559	<title name='Ruairi'/>Then I'll join you.<br/>My goal is...<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Well, I think you know already.<p/>
5560	Iria Falls
5561	<title name='Shaman'/>A human?<br/>What brought you here?<p/>
5562	<title name='Ruairi'/>I want to meet the maker of the Charms.<p/>
5563	<title name='Shaman'/>...Give me a moment.<p/>
5564	<title name='Gael'/>I heard that you're here to see me.<p/>
5565	<title name='Ruairi'/>...Hello.<p/>
5566	<title name='Gael'/>Hello.<p/>
5567	<title name='Ruairi'/>A... friend of mine wants to meet you.<p/>\n				<title name='Ruairi'/>Could I ask you to come with me?<p/>
5568	<title name='Gael'/>What is it?<p/>
5569	<title name='Ruairi'/>Excuse me?<p/>
5570	<title name='Gael'/>You...<br/>What concerns you that much?<p/>
5571	<title name='Ruairi'/>Concern...?<p/>
5572	<title name='Gael'/>Yes.<br/>Sorrow, despair, regret...<br/>All kinds of emotions are mixed up within you.<p/>\n				<title name='Gael'/>I see...<br/>Along with... A hint of hope in your heart.<p/>
5573	<title name='Ruairi'/>No, wait...<p/>
5574	<title name='Gael'/>Is it that girl? A red-haired...<p/>
5575	<title name='Ruairi'/>Stop...<p/>
5576	<title name='Gael'/>Hmm?<p/>
5577	<title name='Shaman'/>What was that? What's going on here?<p/>
5578	<title name='Shaman'/>How could the forces of darkness reach the Holy Land?!<p/>
5579	<title name='Shaman'/>Is he responsible for this?<p/>
5580	<title name='Shaman'/>Stay right there!<p/>
5581	<title name='Shaman'/>Please, calm down and come with us.<p/>\n				<title name='Shaman'/>If you do not resist, this can be resolved peacefully.<p/>
5582	<title name='Ruairi'/>Blast it...<p/>
5583	Renes
5584	<title name='Adniel'/>What do you come here for?<br/>You Mage, you Knight of Darkness.<p/>
5585	<title name='Tarlach'/>Honored dragon, ruler of all dragons.<p/>\n				<title name='Tarlach'/>I'm here to inform you of a great travesty.<p/>\n				<title name='Tarlach'/>Surely you have sensed the corruption of your Conductor?<p/>
5586	<title name='Adniel'/>...<p/>\n				<title name='Adniel'/>You do not wish to destroy this world entirely.<p/>\n				<title name='Adniel'/>What is your goal?<p/>
5587	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
5588	<title name='Tarlach'/>Our only desire is to save this world.<p/>
5589	Back then...
5590	It was exactly like this in the beginning...
5591	Renes
5592	<title name='Tarlach'/>Do you have to do it?<p/>\n				<title name='Tarlach'/>Spirit journeys are much more dangerous than you think.<p/>
5593	<title name='Ruairi'/>If I feared risk, I never would have joined you.<p/>\n				<title name='Ruairi'/>Besides, you know my goal.<br/>I must ask her no matter what.<p/>\n				<title name='Ruairi'/>If you are not going to help me,<br/>I'm done with this plan of yours.<p/>
5594	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
5595	<title name='Tarlach'/>I guess I have no choice, then.<p/>
5596	<title name='Nao'/>Tarlach. Ruairi.<p/>
5597	<title name='Tarlach'/>Mari?! H-how did you get here?!<p/>
5598	<title name='Ruairi'/>!<p/>
5599	<title name='Nao'/><npcportrait name='nao'/>...<p/>
5600	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have a question for you...<p/>
5601	<title name='Nao'/>Ruairi.<br/>You must have many questions for me, but...<p/>\n				<title name='Nao'/>You will never have the answers you seek.<p/>
5602	<title name='Ruairi'/>...Why is that?<p/>
5603	<title name='Nao'/>That's all I can tell you now...<p/>\n				<title name='Nao'/>I'm sorry...<p/>
5604	<title name='Ruairi'/>...That's a shame.<p/>
5605	<title name='Ruairi'/>I'm not going to give up, you know.<p/>
5606	<title name='Tarlach'/>However...<p/>\n				<title name='Tarlach'/>The result will never change.<p/>
5607	<title name='Ruairi'/>That spell is...!<p/>
5608	Black Devil!
5609	In those final moments...\nI'll be your sword.
5610	<title name='Akule'/>Conductor!<p/>\n				<title name='Akule'/>Destroy that structure right now!<p/>
5611	<title name='Akule'/>Explode!<p/>
5612	<title name='Akule'/>Mwahahaha! I got you, you fool!<p/>
5613	<title name='Ruairi'/>That spell is...!<p/>
5614	Black Devil!
5615	In those final moments...\nI'll be your sword.
5616	<title name='Akule'/>Conductor!<p/>\n				<title name='Akule'/>Destroy that structure right now!<p/>
5617	<title name='Akule'/>Explode!<p/>
5618	<title name='Akule'/>Mwahahaha! I got you, you fool!<p/>
5619	Sidhe Sneachta
5620	<title name='Ruairi'/>Here you are, Tarlach.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I brought you the relic that you wanted.<p/>
5621	<title name='Tarlach'/>Goodness, that was quick.<p/>
5622	<title name='Ruairi'/>There are people called shamans in Iria,<br/>and they gave it to me when I told them of your situation.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>So...<br/>This supposedly contains divine power, right?<p/>
5623	<title name='Tarlach'/>Yes indeed.<p/>
5624	<title name='Ruairi'/>Then...should it not have been more carefully guarded?<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I can't help but wonder...is it a fake?<p/>
5625	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ha! No, I don't think so.<p/>
5626	<title name='Ruairi'/>Really? Can you feel something from it?<p/>
5627	<title name='Tarlach'/>Well, I don't know exactly what it is yet...<br/>But yes, even I can feel a power within it.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I'll understand it better after I spend some time studying it.<p/>
5628	<title name='Tarlach'/>Anyway, thank you so much, Ruairi.<p/>
5629	<title name='Ruairi'/>Just let me know whenever you need something.<br/>It seems like that's the only thing I can do for you at this point.<p/>
5630	<title name='Tarlach'/>You could help me in the fight for paradis—<p/>
5631	<title name='Ruairi'/>Other than that.<p/>
5632	<title name='Tarlach'/>I see.<p/>
5633	<title name='Tarlach'/>I hope you hear some good news soon.<p/>
5634	<title name='Ruairi'/>Thanks. I'll be going now.<p/>
5635	I made a staff with\nthe relic that Ruairi brought me.
5636	This staff will make up for\nmy ruined magical abilities from now on.
5637	I can finally study\nin earnest.

5640	<title name='Ruairi'/><npcportrait name='ruari_G2'/>Yeah?<p/>
5641	<title name='Tarlach'/><npcportrait name='Tarlach'/>You are not going to believe this.<p/>
5642	<title name='Tarlach'/>The truth is, Erinn...<p/>
5643	<title name='Ruairi'/>Wait, Tarlach.<br/>I... don't want to hear it.<p/>
5644	<title name='Tarlach'/>Excuse me?<p/>
5645	<title name='Ruairi'/>I don't care about paradise or the goddess.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>Have you already forgotten what happened to us on our journey?<p/>
5646	<title name='Tarlach'/>But Ruairi...<br/>I've finally learned the truth!<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Erinn IS paradise!<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>The Fomors, Tuatha de Dannans, and Milletians are at war,<br/>but if we can stop the gods from meddling in this world...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>Our own world can truly become a paradise.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>People will no longer experience the pain, grief, death, and loss that we had to go through....<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>There are clues in Iria.<br/>If we just dig a little further...<p/>
5647	<title name='Ruairi'/>Stop it. Stop!<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I came back here not only to meet you<br/>but also to find Triona.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I will return to my search for Triona.<p/>\n					<title name='Ruairi'/>I must fulfill my promise that I failed to keep back then...<p/>
5648	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>I understand.<p/>\n					<title name='Tarlach'/>If you can, bring me more of the relics from Iria.<p/>
5649	<title name='Ruairi'/>Fine.<p/>
5650	<title name='Tarlach'/>And if you happen to change your mind...<p/>

5675	"The gods..."
5676	They said,
5677	Once, there were three friends.
5678	The Archer, whose destiny lay in the hands of the Goddess.
5679	The Mage, whose destiny caused him a crisis of faith.
5680	And the Warrior, whose destiny he chose to reject.
5681	They were known as the Three Lost Warriors.
5682	They set out to rescue the fallen Goddess, but found only the cruel whims of fate.
5683	The Archer, Mari.
5684	The Goddess changed her completely... Name, appearance, and destiny.
5685	She was helpless to watch a god kill her father, lost to her when she was still young.
5686	The Mage, Tarlach.
5687	His mortal wounds at the hands of a god cut him off from magic.
5688	He was deceived, and lost his friends and his mentor.\nHe was left utterly alone.
5689	The Warrior, Ruairi.\nHis parents offered him to a dragon as a sacrifice out of greed, even before he was born.
5690	He lost his precious sister, betrayed by a trusted friend.
5691	He saw nothing but despair in mankind, so he sided with the Fomors on the path of darkness.
5692	He left the future in the hands of people from a distant star...and then vanished.
5693	The memories of these three began to fade with time.
5694	After so long,\nthe shadow says,
5695	"The gods..."\n"Do not exist."
5696	<title name='Divine Dragon Alliance Member'/>Who's there?!<p/>
5697	<title name='???'/>Welcome to my realm, cadet.<p/>\n<title name='???'/>You must have already realized that you and your fellow <br/>Milletians are suffering from a mysterious ailment. <br/>\n<title name='???'/>You can't leave, can you? <p/>
5698	<title name='???'/>You may think this an anomaly, but you <br/>would be wrong.<p/>\n<title name='???'/>You see, I am the one who caused this to happen. <p/>\n<title name='???'/>All of you will remain in sleep, unable to wake up in the <br/>outside world.<p/>
5699	<title name='???'/>There is no point attempting to get help from anyone outside. <br/>Any attempts to awaken or unplug one of you will only result <br/>in your destruction. <p/>\n<title name='???'/>You are all, quite simply, trapped here.<p/>
5700	<title name='Divine Dragon Alliance Member'/>Milletians' souls and minds are clearly recorded<br/>in the Soul Stream.<p/>\n<title name='Divine Dragon Alliance Member'/>That's what allows you to be reborn multiple times<br/>without losing the memories of your previous lives...<p/>\n<title name='Divine Dragon Alliance Member'/>But if a Milletian's soul was destroyed, their body here <br/>would likely perish as well...<p/>
5701	<title name='???'/>My grand plan has reached its final stage at last.<p/>\n<title name='???'/>Every player in the world will inevitably fall into<br/>eternal sleep within 30 days!<p/>
5702	<title name='???'/>However...<p/>\n<title name='???'/>There are questions I'd like to have answered before <br/>it's all done. Think of it as a test... to reassure myself.<p/>
5703	<title name='???'/>You need meet only one requirement to release your <br/>fellow Milletians.<p/>\n<title name='???'/>I've created new zones in the dungeons across Erinn.<br/>Alby, Math, Fiodh, and Peaca...<p/>\n<title name='???'/>Speak to my agents at each dungeon and see if you can clear <br/>them all.<p/>
5704	<title name='???'/>If you succeed in time, find me. I will remove this affliction.<p/>\n<title name='???'/>Well, good luck to you all.<p/>
5705	<title name='Heathcliff'/>Hahaha...<br/>I knew you would reach this stage with no difficulty.<p/>\n<title name='Heathcliff'/>...<p/>

5707	<title name='Heathcliff'/>It was curiosity that led me here, you know?<br/>I followed the shadow of my consciousness to Erinn.<p/>\n<title name='Heathcliff'/>And what did I find? Warriors with divine power.<br/>I wondered if all of my beliefs would hold any significance <br/>in this world. <p/>\n<title name='Heathcliff'/>Now I see how strong you really are...<p/>
5708	<title name='Heathcliff'/>I will leave all the zones intact for now.<p/>\n<title name='Heathcliff'/>And then I will leave.<p/>
5709	<title name='Heathcliff'/>Adieu, to all of you!<p/>\n<title name='Heathcliff'/>We shall meet again, cadet <username/>.<p/>

5762	<npcportrait name='berched'/><title name='Berched'/>Merlin. I trust that you will look after young<br/>Tarlach while I'm away at the hot springs?<p/>
5763	<title name='Merlin'/>I do not remember agreeing to that, you old coot.<br/>I've got lots of important druid stuff to do this week!<p/>
5764	<title name='Berched'/>I thought you might enjoy helping Starlet take care of him, <br/>but I suppose I could ask someone else...<p/>
5765	<title name='Merlin'/>Starlet?! Haha, I'm just pulling your leg.<br/>I LOVE BABYSITTING!<p/>
5766	<title name='Berched'/>Take this seriously... <br/>The boy should be well cared for.<p/>
5767	<title name='Tarlach'/>Teacher, can't I just go to the hot springs with you?<br/>Please don't leave me with Merlin.<br/>Please.<p/>
5768	<title name='Berched'/>I'll be back soon enough, Tarlach. You just hold on <br/>to your teddy if you get scared, okay?<p/>
5769	<title name='Merlin'/>Sure, sure. Just get moving before Starlet sees us together. <br/>I mean... before those hot springs cool off. <br/>You've got everything you need, right? I'm sure you do.<br/>Bye! Have fun! Don't come back soon!<p/>
5770	<title name='Merlin'/>You little punk, why are you saying nasty stuff about me?!<p/>
5771	<title name='Tarlach'/>You tore up my drawing!<p/>
5772	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey! Can you make this... thing stop crying?<p/>
5773	<title name='Tarlach'/>Merlin tore up my drawing and he's saying he didn't do <br/>anything, but he DID do something!<p/>
5774	<title name='Merlin'/>Why you little... How was I supposed to know?! You left that stupid<br/>drawing on the floor! Quit leaving things on the floor!<p/>
5775	<title name='Starlet'/>Stop it, Merlin. Tarlach's just a child. <p/>Now, YOU must be the friend Tarlach keeps talking about. I'm Starlet.<p/>
5776	<title name='Merlin'/>Merlin.<p/>
5777	<title name='<username/>'/>I'm <username/>.<p/>

5883	<title name='Ruairi'/>I played with fire magic when I was a little boy, much like you. <p/>
5884	<title name='Tarlach'/>Ohh, my teacher told me I had to be careful when I used magic. You should too.<p/>
5885	<title name='Ruairi'/>How are you? Staying well?<p/>
5886	<title name='Tarlach'/>That's a weird question...<p/>
5887	<title name='Ruairi'/>Just... being polite. I had a younger brother about your age.<p/>

5993	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Wait. Everybody be quiet.<p/>
5994	<title name='Crumena'/>I'll let you lowly mongrels live for now, but this isn't over.<p/>
5995	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What was that... thing you just did?<p/>
5996	<title name='Merlin'/>That was just a taste of my momentous power! Fat lizards are no match for me.<p/>
5997	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You've piqued my interest. I'll find the boy.<p/>
5998	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Really? This is a binding contract. No backsies.<p/>
5999	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>That's fine. Where did you last see him?<p/>
6000	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Port Cobh. We got rooms in the pub and he was gone when we woke up <br/>in the morning.<p/>
6001	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Well, then. That's where we start. I'll meet you there.<p/>
6002	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We need to go to Qilla.<p/>
6003	<title name='Merlin'/>What? I told you we lost him here, in Port Cobh.<p/>
6004	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I asked around town. Nobody's seen a little boy traveling <br/>the roads, but a few dock workers said they saw one in <br/>the early morning.<p/>
6005	<title name='Merlin'/>That's crazy! How could an ordinary little boy get on a boat alone?<p/>
6006	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I guess that means he's no ordinary boy. I'm upping my fee. 100,000 gold for not <br/>trusting me, on top of the 100,000 finder's fee.<p/>
6007	<title name='Merlin'/>What? This is such a rip-off!<p/>
6008	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I found some blonde hair during my investigations. <br/>Does it look like his?<p/>
6009	<title name='Merlin'/>Uh...<p/>
6010	<title name='Merlin'/>FIND THIS BOY.<p/>
6011	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>No problem, for 500,000 gold.<p/>
6012	<title name='Merlin'/>Starlet and Berched are going to hate my guts if they think I lost Tarlach.
6013	<title name='Merlin'/>...
6014	<title name='Merlin'/>Got it! I'll write them a letter! I'll tell them Tarlach was whining about <br/>going to the hot springs, so I took him there out of the goodness of my heart.
6015	<title name='Merlin'/>Maybe I'll just ask for a little money while I'm at it...
6016	To be continued...
6017	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We need to go to Qilla.<p/>

6032	Port Qilla
6033	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Hey there, Pinky.<p/>
6034	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>How are you, my furry friend?<p/>
6035	<title name='Merlin'/>WHAT? It's name is PINKY?!<br/>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br/>Oh my goddess, I'm going to throw up.<p/>
6036	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Show some respect, punk! Pinky might look cute, but she could take <br/>you down. <p/>
6037	<title name='Merlin'/>What? Did you just call me a punk? I am your boss!<p/>
6038	Port Qilla
6039	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Hey there, Pinky.<p/>
6040	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>How are you, my furry friend?<p/>
6041	<title name='Merlin'/>WHAT? It's name is PINKY?!<br/>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br/>Oh my goddess, I'm going to throw up.<p/>
6042	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Show some respect, punk! Pinky might look cute, but she could take <br/>you down. <p/>
6043	<title name='Merlin'/>What? Did you just call me a punk? I am your boss!<p/>
6044	Port Qilla Mana Tunnel
6045	<title name='Merlin'/>You really think he got this far?<p/>
6046	<title name='Merlin'/>We have no idea if he went through the mana tunnel or not. <p/>
6047	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The boy's either headed to Kaypi Canyon or Maiz Prairie. This road <br/>is too heavily trafficked to tell us which way to start though...<p/>
6048	<title name='Merlin'/>Either direction could lead us off the path...<p/>
6049	<title name='Merlin'/>You'd better not be jerking me around here. You're not getting a <br/>single gold piece if anything happens to Tarlach.<p/>
6050	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You're more than welcome to do this alone, if you prefer.<br/> I'm going to Maiz Prairie. <p/>
6051	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Talk to the explorers and archaeologists in Kaypi Canyon.<br/>If they haven't seen the boy, he's not there.<p/>
6052	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Take this map with you and write down anything you find.<br/><p/>
6053	<title name='Merlin'/>Are you seriously trying to get rid of me with a piece of magic paper <br/>right now?<p/>
6054	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'm doing nothing of the sort. These maps are magical. If you mark <br/>the one you have, it'll show up on the one I have. If you find <br/>something, just circle where you are on the map. I'll come.<p/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>And if you lose that, you owe me 1,000,000 gold.<p/>
6055	Muyu Desert Dragon Ruins
6056	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey! How much longer is this going to take, pal?!<p/>
6057	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Stop distracting me! I'm almost done. <br/>Pinky! Keep Merlin busy.<p/>
6058	Get your hands off me, you dang dirty ape!
6059	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Hmm... This is really weird, like--<p/>
6060	<title name='Merlin'/>What the?! Where did those come from?<p/>
6061	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I think it was the book! <br/>Oh no! The map's in there!<p/>
6062	<title name='Merlin'/>Oh, crap!<p/>
6063	<title name='Merlin'/>Look! There are more footprints here. I don't think we're the only <br/>people these slimeballs attacked.<p/>
6064	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The tracks head off toward the Nares Plateau... and they're fresh.<p/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Let's head to the Longa Desert. I think the boy is there.<p/>
6065	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I TOLD you this was a bad plan, Merlin.<p/>
6066	<title name='Merlin'/>We had to check it out. It's not like you got anything in Rupes, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.<p/>
6067	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I came here because I was worried about the two of you. And it's <br/>a good thing, apparently.<p/>
6068	<title name='Merlin'/>Oh, thank you SO much, brave hero. I'm sure these no-name bandits <br/>would have gotten the best of the GREAT-FLIPPING-MERLIN. <p/>
6069	<title name='Merlin'/>Now then...<p/>
6070	<title name='Bandit Cutpurse'/>Argh... Please... Forgive me. Please!<p/>
6071	<title name='Merlin'/>Where is your leader?!<p/>
6072	<title name='Bandit Cutpurse'/>I... I can't remember... <p/>
6073	<title name='Merlin'/>Excellent! I just came up with a really nasty new <br/>thunderbolt spell. Perfect for shock therapy.<p/>
6074	<title name='Bandit Cutpurse'/>N-n-no! Please! The... they're gonna rob the medicine storage <br/>in Filia... You should be able to find him there!<p/>
6075	<title name='Merlin'/>There. That's a good boy.<p/>
6076	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We're heading to Filia then. I have an informant there.<p/>
6077	Cor Village
6078	<title name='Akule'/>Welcome, outsiders! You stand before Akule, the greatest <br/>shaman in the world. <p/>
6079	<title name='NONE'/>(You wave to Akule. )<p/>
6080	<title name='Akule'/>Why, who's this? The conductor who once shared joy <br/>and sorrow with me?!<p/>
6081	<title name='NONE'/>(You ask Akule what he's up to. )<p/>
6082	<title name='Akule'/>I followed a vision here. Now that I see you, I know that it <br/>must have been fate! Haha! How are you now? Still traveling <br/>the world, helping the needy?<p/>
6083	<title name='Kousai'/><username/> cares greatly for people. This is good fortune.<p/>
6084	<title name='Merlin'/>Sorry to break up the reunion, Chief Crazyface, but we're <br/>looking for a little boy.<p/>
6085	<title name='Akule'/>Who are you calling Crazyface?<p/>
6086	<title name='Merlin'/>Did you see a little boy or not? Blonde? Six years old? <br/>Probably complaining about his food?<p/>
6087	<title name='Akule'/>Conductor! Who is this frosted scarecrow that dares <br/>defy my power?!<p/>
6088	<title name='NONE'/>(You do your best to explain Merlin. In general.)<p/>
6089	<title name='Akule'/>I think this boy could use a good hanging from the <br/>thinking tree. A day spent dangling by the toes will <br/>correct his sad superiority complex, don't you agree?<p/>
6090	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>As much as I love the idea of torturing Merlin, we're <br/>a little busy. Have you seen a yellow haired boy with <br/>red eyes? He's about six years old.<p/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>He might have been with men in black robes.<p/>
6091	<title name='Akule'/>A golden haired child with eyes of crimson, carried away <br/>by men of shadows...<p/><title name='Akule'/>These are dark times...<p/><title name='Akule'/>I have seen these omens in dreams; each as a separate nightmare.<p/>
6092	<title name='Kousai'/>I don't know about the boy, but the black robe reminds me. <br/>Tupai mentioned a group of strangers some time ago...<p/>
6093	<title name='Akule'/>That would explain the howling of the wolves...<p/>
6094	<title name='Shamala'/>Grrrr... I feel danger...<p/>
6095	<title name='Akule'/>Shamala, don't bite. These are the Conductor's friends.<p/>
6096	<title name='<username/>'/>(You ask about Millia. )<p/>
6097	<title name='Akule'/>She will awaken soon, I'm certain! She is safe.<p/>
6098	<title name='Merlin'/><username/>! Can we stop the gabbing and get a move on?<p/>
6099	<title name='Akule'/>Why don't I join you? I have a bad feeling about this... <br/>I want to know every detail.<p/>
6100	<title name='Shamala'/>Grrr. You smell familiar... What are you?<p/>
6101	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>That's a good question. What are YOU?<p/>
6102	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey, you two! Hurry it up!<p/>
6103	As the flow of time turns in on itself, angels\nwill appear as harbingers of the beginning.
6104	And when they are done, the three goddesses that \nhave protected this world will lose their seats forever.
6105	Findias's fate does not end here. \nAll will disappear when those who sleep are awakened.
6106	<title name='Merlin'/>Is this girl a ghost or something?! She nearly gave me a heart attack!<p/>
6107	<title name='Akule'/>Conductor. It appears that your friend is holding on <br/>to something dangerous?<p/>
6108	<title name='Akule'/>The ancient book would be safer with me.<p/>
6109	<title name='Akule'/>Th-This book!<p/>
6110	<title name='Akule'/>I cannot read a word of this.<p/>
6111	<title name='Akule'/>The language swirls before my very eyes. Words change and <br/>images shift in my mind. No, no, no...<p/>
6112	<autopass duration='4000'/><title name='Akule'/>Listen to me, and listen well. You are never to open this book <br/>on these mostly holy of grounds.<p/>
6113	<autopass duration='3000'/><title name='Akule'/> In fact, I would recommend that you find a magician to seal it up forever.<p/>
6114	<title name='Merlin'/>He's probably just going to find some poor sucker to sell it to <br/>for a quick payday...<p/>
6115	<title name='Akule'/>You are more clever than you look, frosted man. Keep the <br/>Conductor safe. There is great danger ahead...<p/>
6116	<title name='Akule'/>You are a capable soul, my friend. We have faced many <br/>challenges together. <p/>
6117	<title name='Akule'/>I will be sure to write an article about you for <br/>Cor Village People. Hahaha!<p/>
6118	<npcportrait name='akule'/><title name='Akule'/>Please take care of yourself. I will watch after Millia. <p/>
6119	<title name='Akule'/>I must be off.<p/>
6120	<title name='Akule'/>I have to finish that mask before Millia awakens.<p/>
6121	<title name='Akule'/>May this be but another step on our journey of friendship...<p/>
6122	Ooo! Ah-Ah-Ah!
6123	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I talked to Tupai on our walk here. He said the men in robes <br/>were talking about a balloon and a hot spring. <p/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We need to head north, to Zardine Hot Springs. I believe <br/>they're going to use a hot-air balloon.<p/>
6124	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Okay, we're all set. No sharp objects or loaded guns please.<p/>
6125	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Huh?<p/>
6126	<title name='Merlin'/>There they are! Even their balloon looks evil!<p/>
6127	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>This is our chance. <p/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Everybody get on board!<p/>
6128	<title name='Merlin'/>All we want is the boy! Give him back and I'll let you live.<p/>
6129	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Wait! Something's wrong...<p/>
6130	Enslaved Ifrit
6131	<title name='Merlin'/>Should I drop a glacier on it or smother it with the ocean? <br/>I have so many spells to take out fire monsters.<p/>
6132	<title name='Merlin'/>Geez! Can I at least introduce myself?<p/>
6133	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Do you want a ride? Or would you rather run alongside?<p/>
6134	<title name='Merlin'/>Of course I want a ride.<p/>
6135	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>That will be 300,000 Gold. Tax is separate.<p/>
6136	<title name='Merlin'/>That's robbery!<p/>
6137	<title name='Merlin'/>Why does everyone I meet want to steal my money?!<p/>
6138	<title name='Lopez'/>Hey! Ganso del Blanco! Let's see how confident you are <br/>after a beating from mi tripulacion!<p/>
6139	<title name='Merlin'/>I don't even know what that means, but you guys are <br/>DEAD MEAT! Come on, <username/>!<p/>
6140	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Whoa! That was some pro-level skiing back there!<p/>
6141	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I saw that man's eyes behind the mask...<br/>I think we should get out of here.<p/>
6142	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>And go where?<p/>
6143	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>As far away as we can. Tarlach's been put into a deep sleep. <br/>It's best if we use this time to get away.<p/>
6144	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Whoa! That was some pro-level skiing back there!<p/>
6145	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I saw that man's eyes behind the mask...<br/>I think we should get out of here.<p/>

6148	La Terra Dock
6149	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The knot loosens itself slowly, the body and soul become one...<p/>
6150	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>This will prevent the worst from happening...<p/>
6151	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Everybody up! They're here.<p/>
6152	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Pinky, are you ready? Let's show them how the pros do it!<p/>
6153	<title name='Pinky'/>Hoo-hoo-eeek!<p/>
6154	La Terra Dock
6155	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The knot loosens itself slowly, the body and soul become one...<p/>
6156	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>This will prevent the worst from happening...<p/>
6157	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Everybody up! They're here.<p/>
6158	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Pinky, are you ready? Let's show them how the pros do it!<p/>
6159	<title name='Pinky'/>Hoo-hoo-eeek!<p/>
6160	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>This raft... I smell a trap.<p/>
6161	<title name='Merlin'/>No way! I searched every inch of this raft. It is ship-shape. <br/>Merlin approved!<p/>
6162	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>My hunches are never wrong! Just because you don't see <br/>a problem doesn't mean there isn't one.<p/>
6163	<title name='Merlin'/>Well, too late! They're already here. Everybody on board!<p/>
6164	Cor Rafting Dock
6165	<title name='Merlin'/>Now that we're landbound again, let's swing by <br/>and check on Starlet. I bet she's worried about me.<p/>
6166	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I told you that raft was a bad idea!<p/>
6167	<title name='Merlin'/>Why didn't you say anything?<p/>
6168	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I told you! I told you I smelled a trap!<p/>
6169	<title name='Merlin'/>Nope, sorry, I don't remember that.<p/>
6170	<title name='Merlin'/>Tarlach! Tarlach! Where is he?<p/>
6171	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The boy's gone again, huh? Lucky for you, I'm always prepared <br/>for this sort of thing.<p/>
6172	<title name='Merlin'/>Why on earth do they want Tarlach so bad, anyway? <br/>Did they not notice how INCREDIBLY annoying he is?!<p/>
6173	<autopass duration='1500'/><npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Found them!<p/>
6174	<autopass duration='2000'/><title name='Merlin'/>Gotcha! Tarlach, you're mine!<p/>
6175	<autopass duration='1500'/><title name='Pinky'/>HOO... eek...<p/>
6176	<autopass duration='3500'/><title name='Merlin'/>ACK! Tarlach, what have they done to you?!<p/>
6177	<autopass duration='2000'/><npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Wait... Why do they have another blonde kid?!<p/>
6178	<autopass duration='2000'/><npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You got the wrong Tarlach!<p/>
6179	Metus
6180	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Let's go.<p/>
6181	<title name='Pinky'/>Eek...<p/>
6182	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>No?<p/>
6183	<title name='Merlin'/>Are you sure we can get inside? Maybe we should look around?<p/>
6184	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I've already done enough investigating. If you don't trust me...<p/>
6185	<title name='Merlin'/>What? Is there some 500,000 gold fee for not implicitly <br/>believing every single thing you say?<p/>
6186	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Just shut up and go in.<p/>
6187	<title name='Merlin'/>Okay, okay.<p/>
6188	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>W-what is this place?<p/>
6189	<title name='Merlin'/>I-is this a mirage?<p/>
6190	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Sorry, but no.<p/>
6191	<title name='Merlin'/>That was a turn of phrase, bronzey. But what is it?<br/>\n	Hey, <username/>. Am I going senile?<p/>
6192	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Whoa! What... this place is weird!<p/>
6193	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Oh? Ooooh! Look at me. I am all powerful!<p/>
6194	<title name='Pinky'/>Eeek eek!<p/>
6195	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/><username/>, look! I am Merlin, King of the Ceiling!<p/>
6196	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What a strange place! Nothing like our world... I've never <br/>seen anything like it.<p/>\n					<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Let's go in.<p/>
6197	<title name='Merlin'/>I-is this a mirage?<p/>
6198	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Sorry, but no.<p/>
6199	<title name='Merlin'/>That was a turn of phrase, bronzey. But what is it?<br/>\n	Hey, <username/>. Am I going senile?<p/>
6200	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Ah! What is this! Arghhhh!<p/>
6201	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Oh? Ooooh! Look at me. I am all powerful!<p/>
6202	<title name='Pinky'/>Eeek eek!<p/>
6203	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/><username/>, look! I am Merlin, King of the Ceiling!<p/>
6204	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What a strange place! Nothing like our world... I've never <br/>seen anything like it.<p/>\n					<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Let's go in.<p/>
6205	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>That looks like an exit. Let's go, <username/>!<p/>
6206	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'm not so sure that's an exit.<p/>
6207	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Last time I checked, bright lights usually equal outside. <br/>I thought you were an explorer, man!<p/>
6208	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>My expeditions are usually a little more well-thought-out.<p/>
6209	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Let's just go into the light.<p/>
6210	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What do you think that is?<p/>
6211	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>I don't know... But it reminds me of someone.<p/>
6212	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Who?<p/>
6213	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Some long-haired little punk... Kinda looked like you,<br/>if I remember correctly.<p/>
6214	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>...We can get a better view from up there. Shall we?<p/>
6215	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Do you want a ride? Or do you want to run?<p/>
6216	<title name='Merlin'/>Of course I want a ride.<p/>
6217	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>That will be 300,000 Gold. Tax is separate.<p/>
6218	<title name='Merlin'/>That's highway robbery!<p/>
6219	Nemeton Entrance
6220	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Bingo.<p/>
6221	<title name='Merlin'/>All right. But how do we get back out?<p/>
6222	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We'll figure that out inside.<p/>
6223	<title name='Merlin'/>This is going to sound weird coming from me, but I think <br/>we might be acting a little rash.<p/>
6224	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'll go by myself, if you don't want to.<p/>
6225	<title name='Merlin'/>Tsch, FINALLY making yourself useful, huh? You're not<br/>tricking me. I don't want to get hit with some <br/>"solo hunting" surcharge.<p/>
6226	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I don't care about your money anymore. <p/>
6227	<title name='Merlin'/>HA! Good one.<p/>
6228	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I mean it. You're on your own from here.<p/>
6229	<title name='Merlin'/>What?!<p/>
6230	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I have my own business here. You should be happy. You won't <br/>have to pay me anymore.<p/>
6231	<title name='Merlin'/>You sneak... You used us to get here!<p/>
6232	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'll stay with you as long as I can, but when the time comes...<p/>
6233	<title name='Merlin'/>Come on, <username/>. Don't let him out of your sights.<p/>
6234	Nemeton Entrance
6235	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Bingo.<p/>
6236	<title name='Merlin'/>All right. But how do we get back out?<p/>
6237	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>We'll figure that out inside.<p/>
6238	<title name='Merlin'/>This is going to sound weird coming from me, but I think <br/>we might be acting a little rash.<p/>
6239	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'll go by myself, if you don't want to.<p/>
6240	<title name='Merlin'/>Tsch, FINALLY making yourself useful, huh? You're not<br/>tricking me. I don't want to get hit with some <br/>"solo hunting" surcharge.<p/>
6241	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I don't care about your money anymore. <p/>
6242	<title name='Merlin'/>HA! Good one.<p/>
6243	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I mean it. You're on your own from here.<p/>
6244	<title name='Merlin'/>What?!<p/>
6245	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I have my own business here. You should be happy. You won't <br/>have to pay me anymore.<p/>
6246	<title name='Merlin'/>You sneak... You used us to get here!<p/>
6247	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I'll stay with you as long as I can, but when the time comes...<p/>
6248	<title name='Merlin'/>Come on, <username/>. Don't let him out of your sights.<p/>
6249	Nemeton 2F Lobby
6250	<title name='Merlin'/>We want to go up.<p/>
6251	<title name='Cessair'/>You are not permitted...<p/>
6252	<title name='Merlin'/>But, we reaaallly need to get up there.<p/>
6253	<title name='Cessair'/>What reason?<p/>
6254	<title name='Merlin'/>We met a friend in white on our way here who told us to go up.<p/>
6255	<title name='Cessair'/>Someone in white? No... Show your faces.<p/>
6256	<title name='Cessair'/>Y-you're--<p/>
6257	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/> ...Don't quit your day job, Merlin.<p/>
6258	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey. Hey. Hello? Is it naptime?<p/>
6259	<title name='Merlin'/>What are you doing?<p/>
6260	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>...I wonder if that shaman predicted this. <p/>
6261	<title name='Merlin'/>What? That old geezer with the monkey mask?<p/>
6262	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Yes. He gave me something.<p/>
6263	<title name='Merlin'/>Ooh, what'd you do?<p/>
6264	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Blast it. The door's locked.<p/>
6265	Nemeton 2F Lobby
6266	<title name='Merlin'/>We want to go up.<p/>
6267	<title name='Cessair'/>You are not permitted...<p/>
6268	<title name='Merlin'/>But, we reaaallly need to get up there.<p/>
6269	<title name='Cessair'/>What reason?<p/>
6270	<title name='Merlin'/>We met a friend in white on our way here who told us to go up.<p/>
6271	<title name='Cessair'/>Someone in white? No... Show your faces.<p/>
6272	<title name='Cessair'/>Y-you're--<p/>
6273	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/> ...If you ever had dreams of becoming an actor, I would <br/>abandon them now. <p/>
6274	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey. Hey. Hello? Is it naptime?<p/>
6275	<title name='Merlin'/>What are you doing?<p/>
6276	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>...I wonder if that shaman predicted this. <p/>
6277	<title name='Merlin'/>What? That old geezer with the monkey mask?<p/>
6278	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Yes. He gave me something.<p/>
6279	<title name='Merlin'/>Ooh,what'd you do?<p/>
6280	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Wait, the door... It's locked.<p/>
6281	<title name='Ruairi'/>Must we do this, Dian?<p/>
6282	<title name='Dian'/>I thought you wanted him to grow up as a normal boy.<p/>
6283	<title name='Ruairi'/>I... I'm afraid we're making the wrong choice.<p/>
6284	<title name='Dian'/>Fear breeds doubt, and doubt brings tragedy. You must <br/>trust your instincts.<p/>
6285	<title name='Ruairi'/>Is that why you abandoned your emotions?<p/>
6286	<title name='Dian'/>I abandoned them so I could do the right thing. I would do <br/>anything to achieve my goals...<p/>
6287	<title name='Ruairi'/>Even if it turns you into a monster?<p/>
6288	<title name='Dian'/>Determination requires sacrifice.<p/>
6289	<title name='Ruairi'/>...Tarlach.<p/>
6290	<title name='Dian'/>Do you want to talk to your friend?<p/>
6291	<title name='Ruairi'/>No. I know why I'm here. I know what I have to do.<p/>
6292	<title name='Dian'/>Then you need not ponder anymore.<p/>\n					<title name='Dian'/>You will lose everything if you allow yourself to be greedy now.<br/>\n					You said yourself that your greed cost you everything. <p/>\n					<title name='Dian'/>Do not let this weakness drive you again.<p/>
6293	<title name='Ruairi'/>I pity you.<p/>
6294	<title name='Dian'/>If you had real emotion, you wouldn't say that...<p/>
6295	<title name='Dian'/>You would say, I'm sad for you.<p/>
6296	<title name='Dian'/>And your heart would be broken.<p/>
6297	<title name='Ruairi'/>...I will follow the plan.<p/>
6298	<title name='Dian'/>Yes, push your hurt down deep. Think only of the end.<p/>
6299	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>What happens after you throw everything away?<p/>
6300	<title name='Dian'/>Nothing remains, of course.<p/>
6301	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>That ending seems quite dark.<p/>
6302	<title name='Dian'/>Is it? I can no longer recognize dark from light. I understand<br/>in a rational capacity, but the feelings aren't there. <br/>But you already knew that, didn't you, Cecht?<p/>
6303	<title name='Cecht'/>It's been a while since you called me by that name.<p/>
6304	<title name='Dian'/>Dwelling on our seperation produces some rather unproductive <br/> thoughts. We will be one again soon enough. <p/>
6305	<title name='Cecht'/>You've become a monster.<p/>
6306	<title name='Dian'/>Monsters and gods are not all that different. <br/>They both inspire misunderstanding in lesser creatures...<p/>
6307	<title name='Cecht'/>And fear.<p/>
6308	<title name='Dian'/>Why are you here?<p/>
6309	<title name='Cecht'/>The preparations are complete.<p/>
6310	<title name='Dian'/>I see.<p/>
6311	<title name='Cecht'/>And there is an intruder.<p/>
6312	<title name='Dian'/>Is it...<p/>
6313	<title name='Cecht'/>That is what I presume. <p/>
6314	<title name='Dian'/>Lock down the tower. Let no one escape.<p/>
6315	<title name='Ruairi'/>The time is coming... <br/>In the old days, you would be on my side.<p/>
6316	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
6317	<title name='Ruairi'/>I feel as if I have lost control of this plan, Tarlach. <br/>I find myself wondering why I couldn't just be happy <br/>with the way things were.<p/>
6318	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
6319	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have to believe that we didn't make the wrong choice. <br/>I have to believe that we can change your destiny. <p/>
6320	<title name='Ruairi'/>When this is done, your past will not plague you, Tarlach. <p/>\n<title name='Ruari'/>You can forget all the bad memories. When you awake, you'll be normal.<br/>You'll be happy...<p/>
6321	<title name='Tarlach'/>That's impossible, Ruairi.<p/>
6322	<title name='Ruairi'/>What do you mean?<p/>
6323	<title name='Tarlach'/>This tower is made of lies...<p/>
6324	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tarlach?<p/>
6325	<title name='Tarlach'/>There are no right or wrong answers. Destiny is ours to manipulate.<p/>
6326	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tarlach wanted me to give this to you.<p/>
6327	<title name='Ruairi'/>I want him to have a normal life. If you care about him at all, <br/>you'll let me finish what I have begun.<p/>
6328	<title name='Merlin'/>What about the cost? The ritual's going to take someone's life!<p/>
6329	<title name='Ruairi'/>The people in this tower have been cursed for longer than <br/>anyone could imagine. If a sacrifice will end so much suffering,<br/>so be it...<p/>					<title name='Ruairi'/>We are going to use the God Fragment. It would be best <br/>if you accepted that fact.<p/>
6330	<title name='Merlin'/>You don't even know if it will work!<p/>
6331	<title name='Merlin'/>This is completely irresponsible.<p/>
6332	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is what must be done. Maybe your other friend could <br/>explain it to you.<p/>
6333	<title name='Merlin'/>Wait... I feel a strange energy.<p/>
6334	<title name='Merlin'/>I think I can use this to break the barrier. Maybe Tarlach<br/>sent it to us on purpose...<p/>
6335	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tarlach wanted me to give this to you.<p/>
6336	<title name='Ruairi'/>I want him to have a normal life. If you care about him at all, <br/>you'll let me finish what I have begun.<p/>
6337	<title name='Merlin'/>What about the cost? The ritual's going to take someone's life!<p/>
6338	<title name='Ruairi'/>The people in this tower have been cursed for longer than <br/>anyone could imagine. If a sacrifice will end so much suffering,<br/>so be it...<p/>					<title name='Ruairi'/>We are going to use the God Fragment. It would be best <br/>if you accepted that fact.<p/>
6339	<title name='Merlin'/>And you want to lift that curse?<p/>
6340	<title name='Merlin'/>This is completely irresponsible.<p/>
6341	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is what must be done. Maybe your other friend could <br/>explain it to you.<p/>
6342	<title name='Merlin'/>Wait... I feel a strange energy.<p/>
6343	<title name='Merlin'/>I think I can use this to break the barrier. Maybe Tarlach<br/>sent it to us on purpose...<p/>
6344	<title name='Dian'/>I felt the waves of energy twisting. We have an uninvited guest...<p/>
6345	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Dian Cecht!  No... Dian! Why did you do that?<p/>
6346	<title name='Dian'/>Ah, the child of Bith. You're alive.<p/>
6347	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Why... Why did you kill everyone? Why did you wipe out <br/>our future?!<p/>
6348	<title name='Dian'/>Birren got what he wanted and left. Bith didn't trust me until <br/>the end. I underestimated them.<p/>
6349	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You know how many peoples' lives you sacrificed to be <br/>in that seat. You know better than anyone... <br/>HOW COULD YOU?!<p/>
6350	<title name='Dian'/>People make sacrifices. I couldn't let them be in vain.<p/>
6351	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You've had a lot of time to make up your excuses. You know <br/>what mother wanted when she handed everything off to you!<p/>
6352	<title name='Dian'/>Ah... another guest. And I still have so much to do.<p/>
6353	<title name='Dian'/>I don't have anything more to say to you. Why don't you take a rest?<p/>
6354	<title name='Merlin'/>This place is all messed up. This energy here is a tapestry of <br/>morbid lies and broken promises...<p/>
6355	<title name='Merlin'/>Whoa, why is everyone trying to spook me?<p/>
6356	<title name='Dian'/>Another guest. This child let you in, yes?<p/>
6357	<title name='Dian'/>I was told you were locked away. How did you escape?<p/>
6358	<title name='Merlin'/>Sorry lady, but I owe that creep a lot of money, and I <br/>don't like having unpaid debts. <p/>
6359	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey, Suntan Steve! How about I save your life and we call it even? <p/>
6360	<title name='Merlin'/>...Um, okay. I guess this lady is kind of good at magic.<p/>
6361	<title name='Dian'/>Is that all? Maybe I can convince you otherwise...<p/>
6362	<title name='Dian'/>See if you can stop me now!<p/>
6363	<title name='Dian'/>I'm sure you won't listen... but I must finish what I was saying.<p/>\n					<title name='Dian'/>I never longed for revenge. I knew what Bith desired from <br/>the beginning. That is why I separated myself. That is why <br/>I discarded my emotions. I believed it would make me perfect...<p/>\n					<title name='Dian'/>But I could never lose my desire for vengeance... And now, <br/>it has ruined everything.<p/>
6364	<title name='Dian'/>I saw that you were alive...<p/>\n					<title name='Dian'/>And that vengefulness awoke withing me...<p/>
6365	<title name='Merlin'/>Oh, hey! I almost forgot! Now that I saved your life, you <br/>owe me BIG TIME! I'm thinking a billion gold would be fair...<p/>
6366	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Whatever. If we don't get out of here, we're not getting <br/>anything at all. Focus!<p/>
6367	<title name='Merlin'/>I hate it when you act reasonable. I've got my eye on you!<p/>
6368	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Oh... That looks like the exit over there. Let's go, <username/>!<p/>
6369	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Are you sure that's the exit?<p/>
6370	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Are you stupid? Dark means inside, bright means outside!<br/>I thought you were an explorer, man!<p/>
6371	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>My explorations are usually a little more well-thought-out.<p/>
6372	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Sure, whatever. I see the outside. Let's go.<p/>
6373	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>That is not what I was expecting to see.<p/>
6374	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>That's weird. This reminds me of something...<p/>
6375	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What?<p/>
6376	<npcportrait name='merlin'/><title name='Merlin'/>Some long-haired little punk... It's been a while since I <br/>even thought about it.<p/>
6377	<npcportrait name='treasurehunter'/><title name='Treasure Hunter'/>You can take a walk down memory lane later. Let's see if we <br/>can get to a better vantage point.<p/>
6378	Nemeton Altar
6379	<title name='Ruairi'/>I've told you. I only want to eradicate the God Fragment.<p/>
6380	<title name='Ruairi'/>Why do you want to stop me?<p/>
6381	<title name='Merlin'/>Dian is lying to you!<p/>
6382	<title name='Ruairi'/>Why should I trust you?<p/>
6383	<title name='Merlin'/>You can't just throw your life away on some crazy ritual.<p/>
6384	<title name='Ruairi'/>Are none of my secrets sacred? You've figured out my plan, druid, <br/>but the reality has not changed. I will go through with the ritual.<p/>
6385	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Then why? You and the child will die now that the ritual's <br/>main catalyst is g-- <br/><br/>Huh? What the...<p/>
6386	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>The ritual... it's different.<p/>
6387	<title name='Ruairi'/>Yes. I've made a little change that will pave the way for a <br/>bigger change.<p/>
6388	<title name='Merlin'/>What? You can't just TWEAK a crazy magic ritual.<p/>
6389	<title name='Merlin'/>Did the kid really regain his memories?<p/>
6390	<title name='Merlin'/>What are you scheming now?<p/>
6391	<title name='Ruairi'/>I do not need to explain myself to you. Stand aside.<p/>
6392	<title name='Merlin'/>Come back here and wake up Tarlach! Let me talk to him, <br/>at least!<p/>
6393	<title name='Ruairi'/>Stop them, Heart.<p/>
6394	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I was hoping I could see the sky once more before everything ended... <p/>
6395	<title name='Merlin'/>AH!<p/>
6396	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I honestly don't care what happens in the end, but I would <br/>be happy for some entertainment while I have the opportunity.<p/>
6397	<title name='Merlin'/>Why does every villain think fighting is so entertaining?<p/>
6398	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Dian Cecht wanted to become the mechanical overseer of<br/>Nemeton. She created me by detaching her emotions.<p/>
6399	<title name='Merlin'/>Huh. I didn't know you could just toss <br/>your emotions aside like a worn jacket.<p/>
6400	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Perhaps you have a point. She did keep the name Dian. <br/>It must have held some lingering significance to her.<p/>
6401	<title name='Merlin'/>Yeah, why aren't you called Dian's Heart?<p/>
6402	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I believe she did not want to feel any attachment to me... <p/>
6403	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Dian Cecht ruled over the Cessair. Our power came from a <br/>contract with a great golden dragon.<p/>
6404	<title name='Merlin'/>I'm not here for a history lesson and I'm not about to let you <br/>stall for time!<p/>
6405	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Ha... I am only trying to educate you so that you aren't <br/>surprised by what happens from here on.<p/>
6406	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Once I am whole again, the <br/>dragon's soul will be mine. I will be a god...<p/>
6407	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>It seems you were stronger than I thought...<p/>
6408	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>The non-human who works for the humans.<br/>The outsider who works for Erinn.<p/>
6409	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I wonder how long you will all stick together.<p/>
6410	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I have enjoyed watching you all...<p/>
6411	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>I speak now to the Settler child who toiled in obscurity...<p/>
6412	<title name="Cessair's Heart"/>Live to your heart's content.<p/>
6413	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/> L-let's go that way for now!<p/>
6414	<title name='Merlin'/>Do you think we can get through?<p/>
6415	<title name='Merlin'/>I kind of think we're going to get fried.<p/>
6416	Gahhhhhhhhhhhh!
6417	<title name='Merlin'/>Anybody have a plan for this?<p/>
6418	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I have an idea. I think I can break the altar if we bust <br/>a few of these big crystals, but I need backup.<p/>
6419	<title name='Merlin'/>Got it! I'm on punkbusting duty then? No problem.<p/>
6420	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Let's get to it, before it's too late.<p/>
6421	<title name='Ruairi'/>You plan on interfering until the very end then?<p/>
6422	<title name='Ruairi'/>I need to conserve my strength. I'll just have to bring in <br/>some help.<p/>
6423	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey, I've never seen these guys before. What magical new <br/>adventures await us, friends?!<p/>
6424	<title name='Merlin'/>Aw, you're just a bunch of goons! And here I thought we could <br/>have a decent battle...<p/>
6425	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>They're recovering too fast. We're running out of time...<p/>
6426	<title name='Merlin'/>It's always up to Merlin to save the day.<p/>
6427	<title name='Merlin'/>Milletian! I'm counting on you to deal with the redhead. <br/>I'm gonna have my hands full.<p/>
6428	<title name='Merlin'/>Don't you dare get yourself killed!<p/>
6429	<title name='Merlin'/>HEY! I thought you were going to DO something!<p/>
6430	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>They're recovering too fast. I don't know if I can keep control!<p/>
6431	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>No, they're recovering faster than I thought. I can't do much <br/>with them in complete control of the altar.<p/>
6432	<title name='Merlin'/>Milletian! I'm counting on you to deal with this,<br/>okay? I've got my hands full.<p/>
6433	<title name='Merlin'/>I'm gonna cast something big! Make it count!<p/>
6434	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have to do it... now...<p/>
6435	<title name='Ruairi'/>My strength was lacking... All that pain and suffering, all for...<p/>
6436	<title name='Ruairi'/>...This is finally the end.<p/>
6437	<title name='Merlin'/>What are you doing, <username/>?!<p/>
6438	<title name='Merlin'/>I told you not to get yourself killed!<p/>
6439	<title name='Merlin'/>Hnnnnggghhhhhh!<p/>
6440	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tell me what I have to do.<p/>
6441	<title name='Cecht'/>It's something that no one could force you to do.<p/>
6442	<title name='Cecht'/>You must die in his stead.<p/>
6443	<title name='Cecht'/>Destroy the altar just as the ceremony finishes, and the door <br/>will open. The price of the sacrifice will shift to you...<p/>
6444	<title name='Cecht'/>Are you sure you want to do this?<br/>This boy is not the one you knew... <p/>\n					<title name='Cecht'/>Would you really sacrifice yourself just so that he could<br/>have a normal life?<p/>
6445	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is the only choice I have left to make.<p/>
6446	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have to believe I can still save him.<p/>
6447	<title name='Ruairi'/>Just like old times...<p/>
6448	...and <username/>
6449	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have to do it... now...<p/>
6450	<title name='Ruairi'/>My strength was lacking... All that pain and suffering, all for...<p/>
6451	<title name='Merlin'/>What are you doing, <username/>?!<p/>
6452	<title name='Merlin'/>I told you not to get yourself killed!<p/>
6453	<title name='Merlin'/>Hnnnnggghhhhhh!<p/>
6454	<title name='Merlin'/>Hnnnnggghhhhhh!<p/>
6455	<title name='Ruairi'/>Tell me what I have to do.<p/>
6456	<title name='Cecht'/>It's something that no one could force you to do.<p/>
6457	<title name='Cecht'/>You must die in his stead.<p/>
6458	<title name='Cecht'/>Destroy the altar just as the ceremony finishes, and the door <br/>will open. The price of the sacrifice will shift to you...<p/>
6459	<title name='Cecht'/>Are you sure you want to do this?<br/>This boy is not the one you knew... <p/>\n					<title name='Cecht'/>Would you really sacrifice yourself just so that he could<br/>have a normal life?<p/>
6460	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is the only choice I have left to make.<p/>
6461	<title name='Ruairi'/>I have to believe I can still save him.<p/>
6462	<title name='Ruairi'/>Just like old times...<p/>
6463	...and <username/>
6464	<title name='Merlin'/>Tarlach?! You're alive!<p/>
6465	<title name='Tarlach'/>Huh? Merlinnnnnn!<p/>
6466	<title name='Merlin'/>Who told you to go around opening doorways to alternate <br/>realities?! Huh?!<p/>
6467	<title name='Tarlach'/>H-huh? What's wrong Merlin?<p/>
6468	<title name='Merlin'/>I want to talk to that jerk inside you! Where are you?!<p/>
6469	<title name='Tarlach'/>Wahhhhhh!<p/>
6470	<title name='Merlin'/>Quit acting and come out here! Face me, you snake!<p/>
6471	Ow!
6472	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Knock it off! You're scaring him.<p/>
6473	<title name='Merlin'/>OW!<p/>
6474	<title name='Merlin'/>Ah... Ahem. Sorry, I got a little carried away. <br/>I think he's clean. He's just a normal kid now.<p/><title name='Merlin'/>Wait... now I have a dumb little kid to babysit again! <br/>Why have I been chasing after him this whole time?!<p/>
6475	<title name='Merlin'/><username/>! Take the kid back to the old geezer for me. <br/>You owe me for saving your life.<p/>
6476	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>What were you trying to do?<p/>
6477	<title name='Merlin'/>Huh?<p/>
6478	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Why did you just attack the boy with that God Fragment thing?<p/>
6479	<title name='Merlin'/>Oh, that.<p/>
6480	<title name='Merlin'/>Well, you have to make a pledge if you want to know.<p/>
6481	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>A pledge?<p/>
6482	<title name='Merlin'/>Yes, a pledge to join the secret group that protects Erinn.<br/>Be warned, this pledge can't be broken. It's like a curse...<p/>
6483	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>I seem to end up doing that all the time anyway. What do <br/>I have to do?<p/>
6484	<title name='Merlin'/>Wow, did you believe me? Ha! You are SO gullible.<p/>
6485	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Why you...<p/>
6486	<title name='Merlin'/>Okay, okay I'll tell!<p/>
6487	<title name='Merlin'/>Listen carefully. I won't say this twice.<p/>
6488	<title name='Merlin'/>Hey, wait, what is your real name?<p/>
6489	<title name='Merlin'/>Surely it can't be the Treasure Hunter.<p/>
6490	<title name='Ruairi'/>The people in this tower have been cursed for longer than <br/>anyone could imagine. If a sacrifice will end so much suffering,<br/>so be it...<p/>					<title name='Ruairi'/>We are going to use the God Fragment. It would be best <br/>if you accepted that fact.<p/>
6491	<title name='Merlin'/>You don't even know if it will work!<p/>
6492	<title name='Merlin'/>This is completely irresponsible.<p/>
6493	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is what must be done. Maybe your other friend could <br/>explain it to you.<p/>
6494	<title name='Ruairi'/>The people in this tower have been cursed for longer than <br/>anyone could imagine. If a sacrifice will end so much suffering,<br/>so be it...<p/>					<title name='Ruairi'/>We are going to use the God Fragment. It would be best <br/>if you accepted that fact.<p/>

6497	<title name='Ruairi'/>This is what must be done. Maybe your other friend could <br/>explain it to you.<p/>
6498	<title name='Merlin'/>Oh, hey! I almost forgot! Now that I saved your life, you <br/>owe me BIG TIME! I'm thinking a billion gold would be fair...<p/>
6499	<title name='Treasure Hunter'/>Whatever. If we don't get out of here, we're not getting <br/>anything at all. Focus!<p/>
6500	<title name='Merlin'/>I hate it when you act reasonable. I've got my eye on you!<p/>
6501	<title name='Ruairi'/>This will be our final battle. Don't hold back, <username/>.
6502	<title name='Ruairi'/>I need more time!<p/>
6503	<title name='Ruairi'/>I... I don't care what happens to me. I don't care if I <br/>become a monster...
6504	<title name='Tarlach'/>The sun was so pretty today. And Kristell bought me candy!<p/>
6505	<title name='Tarlach'/>You wanna try some? It's really tasty.<p/>
6506	<title name='Merlin'/>That sugar's gonna keep you up all night.<p/>
6507	<title name='Tarlach'/>I don't wanna go to sleep. I'll have nightmares.<p/>
6508	<title name='Merlin'/>It's just a stupid dream. How bad could it be?<p/>
6509	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
6510	<title name='Merlin'/>What? What kind of nightmares are you having?<p/>
6511	<title name='Tarlach'/>I don't wanna tell...<p/>
6512	<title name='Tarlach'/>If I tell, the nightmare will come back.<p/>
6513	<title name='Tarlach'/>The sun was so pretty today. And Kristell bought me candy!<p/>

6517	<title name='Merlin'/>It's just a stupid dream. How bad could it be?<p/>
6518	<title name='Tarlach'/>...<p/>
6519	<title name='Merlin'/>What? What kind of nightmares are you having?<p/>
6520	<title name='Tarlach'/>I don't wanna tell...<p/>
6521	<title name='Tarlach'/>If I tell, the nightmare will come back.<p/>
6522	<title name='Merlin'/><username/>! You've got a mouth like a sailor! Haha!<p/>
6523	<title name='Merlin'/><username/>! You've got a mouth like a sailor! Haha!<p/>
6524	Shinobi: Where are you? Show yourself, punk!
6525	Shinobi: I know you ran this way!
6526	Shinobi: Argh! I'll find you one day!
6527	Anju: Wait little chicken! We can be friends!
6528	Anju: Ack! Who are you?!
6529	Anju: Uh... I know this looks bad, but... ummm....
6530	Anju: Ninja vanish!
6531	Friends: Hey! Little clumsy Anju! You're a dumb old dumb head!
6532	Friends: Whoa! A bear! Let it eat Anju! R-RUN!
6533	Hagi: Tsch... Chumps! Didn't even see past my bear disguise.
6534	Anju: Hagi! You saved me! Thank you!
6535	Hagi: I-I didn't do that to help you! I did it because...
6536	Hagi: Oh! I want to be the best ninja ever! My ninjutsu is going to be top notch.
6537	Anju: A ninja? That's amazing, Hagi. I just know you'll be the strongest ninja of all time.
6538	Hagi: Maybe you should become a ninja too! You can be my first pupil!
6539	Anju: Me? No, I don't think that's a good idea...
6540	Anju: I'm so clumsy! What if I turned us into toadstools?!
6541	Hagi: That's not even a real spell. Here, you just need confidence. Take this.
6542	Anju: A paper shuriken?
6543	Hagi: I have one just like it. From now on, this is our team symbol.
6544	Anju: Yes!
6545	<title name='Hagi'/>Great job! Both of you did well, even without me!<p/>
6546	<title name='Hagi'/>The boss dropped the scroll we're looking for around here somewhere...<p/>
6547	<title name='Hagi'/>There it is!<p/>
6548	<title name='Anju'/>Wow! We did it, Hagi!<p/>
6549	<title name='Hagi'/>Yeah! You two did great.<p/>
6550	<title name='Hagi'/>I think you're ready for my advanced course.<p/>\n					<title name='Hagi'/>Don't think I'll go easy though. This is--<p/>
6551	<title name='Anju'/>Hagi! Watch out!<p/>
6552	<title name='Shinobi'/>Foolish little fox thief. You're here because I wanted you here.<br/>You fell for my trap!<p/>
6553	<title name='Hagi'/>A-Anju!<p/>
6554	<title name='Anju'/>Hagi, get out of here! Urk...<p/>
6555	<title name='Shinobi'/>Haha, you're just going to leave the girl behind?<br/>Give me the scrolls you stole, and maybe I'll play nice.<p/>\n					<title name='Shinobi'/>It's not like either of you could handle the power inside.<p/>\n					<title name='Shinobi'/>Especially you, little fox!<p/>
6556	<title name='Hagi'/>I-I-I can't!<p/>
6557	<title name='Shinobi'/>You fools follow this coward around?<p/>
6558	<title name='Shinobi'/>Hey, you!<p/>\n					<title name='Shinobi'/>Tell that little kid that if he doesn't want to lose his lady, <br/>he'd better get back here with my scrolls... RIGHT NOW!<p/>
6559	<title name='Shinobi'/>Enough games! Any more of this nonsense, <br/>and you can say goodbye to the girl!<p/>
6560	<title name='Anju'/><username/>! Arg... Lemme go, you creep!<p/>
6561	<title name='Shinobi'/>Where's the fox kid?<br/>Too scared to come?<p/>
6562	<title name='Anju'/>No! Hagi's the toughest, best ninja ever!<p/>
6563	<title name='Hagi'/>I'm here for you, Anju!<p/>
6564	<title name='Shinboi'/>Oooh, how daring.<br/>Now give me my scrolls!<p/>
6565	<title name='Hagi'/>Scrolls? Oh, I don't have those anymore.<p/>
6566	<title name='Shinobi'/>Then I guess you don't have a girlfriend anymore either.<p/>
6567	<title name='Hagi'/>She's not my girlfriend! I mean... <br/>Take me instead!<p/>\n					<title name='Hagi'/>Just let her go!<p/>
6568	<title name='Shinobi'/>Sacrificing yourself? Breaks my heart. <p/>\n					<title name='Shinobi'/>I guess one dead vermin's the same as the other. <p/>
6569	<title name='Hagi'/>ARG!<p/>
6570	<title name='Anju'/>Hagi!<p/>
6571	<title name='Shinobi'/>This is what happens when you mess with a real ninja! <br/>Now, tell me where my scrolls are!<p/>
6572	<title name='Hagi'/>I-I-I told ya, I got rid of them...<p/>\n					<title name='Hagi'/>But not before I became... <p/>
6573	<title name='Shinobi'/>What the?!<p/>
6574	<title name='Hagi'/>A master of disguise!!<p/>
6575	<title name='Anju'/>H-hagi! Amazing!<br/>You were a log!<br/>I knew you were amazing!<p/>
6576	<title name='Hagi'/>Did I scare you, Anju? <br/>Sorry I had to show you the real ninja magic.<p/>
6577	<title name='Anju'/>N-no, Hagi. You've been watching out for me <br/>since we were little.<p/>\n					<title name='Anju'/>You're the best!<p/>
6578	To be continued...
6579	To be continued...
6580	<title name='Mad Seer'/>He will come! He will come to redeem us!<p/>\n					<title name='Crazy Prophet'/>Salvation will be proven by the mighty power. Open your eyes to the truth...<p/>\n					<title name='Crazy Prophet'/>The chosen will be acknowledged as an Apostle and be blessed with tremendous power!<p/>
6581	<title name='Mysterious Young Man'/>Umm...hello! Milletian!<p/>\n					<title name='Mysterious Young Man'/>Uh...um...so...I am...<p/>
6582	<title name='Mysterious Young Man'/>I've been watching you for a long, long time! Could you please<br/>give me your hand so that I could have a handshake and touch <br/>your hand with my... hand? Please don't run away, I'm a huge fan.<p/>
6583	<title name='Wolfman'/>Your mastery of battle is impressive, just as I expected.<br/>I am pleased to see that your reputation is deserved.<p/>
6584	<title name='Wolfman'/>This has been a good meeting. We shall see each other again...<p/>
6585	<title name='Avelin'/>Brilluen?!<p/>
6586	<title name='Brilluen'/>Wow, you got the Milletian to help you?! Poor little knights. <br/>Me and the boys are just out of your league, aren't we?<p/>
6587	<title name='Avelin'/>How did you know we were here?<p/>
6588	<title name='Brilluen'/>Oh, you know me. I like to know everything all the time. I even <br/>brought you a little gift!<p/>
6589	<title name='Brilluen'/>Ta-da! This little fellow is much stronger than the last one you met.<p/>
6590	<title name='Brilluen'/>He's such a good little boy! Please show him a fun time!<p/>
6591	<title name='Avelin'/>We need to break down its defenses, as Altam did before.<p/>
6592	<title name='Avelin'/>I can't believe that sloppy fool got himself in trouble. We could <br/>actually use him right now...<p/>
6593	<title name='Avelin'/>There's no choice. We must leave. Take any chance you can to <br/>escape, <username/>. I will do the same.<p/>
6594	<title name='Talvish'/>Hmmm...<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>Avelin? Did you just tell someone to flee from battle?<p/>
6595	<title name='Avelin'/>Talvish?<p/>
6596	<title name='Talvish'/>You should take your own advice once in a while.<p/>
6597	<title name='Avelin'/>We have no time for your quips, Talvish. Help us take care of <br/>this pest before the she-devil gets any further away. <p/>
6598	<title name='Pennar'/>I told you that I would prefer an honest duel, but I must obey <br/>my orders.<p/>
6599	<title name='Pennar'/>You are a great warrior, <username/>. What I am about to do <br/>brings me no honor.<p/>
6600	<title name='Brilluen'/>I was wondering when you were going to stop yapping, wolfie.<p/>
6601	<title name='Marcan'/>Don't kill. We take. We bind. We break the spirit.<p/>
6602	<title name='Pennar'/>Just like our masters want...<p/>
6603	<title name='Pennar'/>I told you that I would prefer an honest duel, but I must obey <br/>my orders.<p/>
6604	<title name='Pennar'/>I hate to lose a chance to battle a great warrior like yourself.<p/>
6605	<title name='Brilluen'/>Oh dear, you just can't keep your big mouth shut, can you?<p/>
6606	<title name='Marcan'/>Don't kill. Take it, bind it, and smash it to break the thing inside.<p/>
6607	<title name='Pennar'/>Right. Just the way it is...<p/>
6608	<title name='Avelin'/>We can crack his defense if we block this attack! Altam! <br/>Get ready!<p/>
6609	<title name='Avelin'/>I'm sorry that I doubted you, <username/>. You are truly one <br/>of us. All together now. We will destroy this abomination!<p/>
6610	<title name='Avelin'/>We can crack his defense if we block this attack! Altam! <br/>Get ready!<p/>
6611	<title name='Avelin'/>I'm sorry that I doubted you, <username/>. You are truly one <br/>of us. All together now. We will destroy this abomination!<p/>
6612	<title name='Altam'/>All out of lackies, huh? Tell us what you're scheming!<p/>
6613	<title name='Brilluen'/>I don't have to explain myself to nosy children.<p/>
6614	<title name='Avelin'/>Explain yourself to me, Brilluen, if you think it will help.<p/>
6615	<title name='Brilluen'/>Sweet Avelin, always one step behind. Just like the last time...<p/>
6616	<title name='Avelin'/>You! Don't you ever talk about that! I'll kill you where you stand!<p/>
6617	<title name='Brilluen'/>Hahahaha! Are we still holding a grudge about THAT? You are<br/>unbearably adorable.<p/>
6618	<title name='Black Wizard'/>He has granted all that you desire.<p/>
6619	<title name='Black Wizard'/>Now you must grant His desire. Give yourself to our god and <br/>He will grant your greatest wishes.<p/>
6620	<title name='Eirawen'/>I-I can't believe it. T-those monsters were human?!<p/>
6621	<title name='Royal Guard Captain'/>We have to get you out of here. Let the Milletian <br/>take over!<p/>
6622	<title name='Eirawen'/>...No! Not anymore!<p/>
6623	<title name='Royal Guard Captain'/>M-my queen...<p/>
6624	<title name='Eirawen'/>I stood up for what was right once before...<p/>
6625	<title name='Eirawen'/>We can't expect <username/> to just fix every problem we <br/>encounter. This fight is ours.<p/>
6626	<title name='Royal Guard Captain'/>Please, my grace! There is nothing we can do here. We must <br/>get you to safety!<p/>
6627	<title name='Royal Guard Captain'/>Come, the underground pathways will be safe! We can still <br/>get out of here!<p/>
6628	<title name='Eirawen'/>I won't leave! I will see the end with my own eyes.<p/>
6629	<title name='Royal Guard Captain'/>Please, my queen. This is a fight between gods! Humans have <br/>no place here.<p/>
6630	<title name='Eirawen'/>If <username/> is a god, then we're lucky enough to have a <br/>god on our side. Everyone stay where you are! We will not <br/>abandon our allies in their time of need!<p/>
6631	<title name='Mysterious Lady'/>You've risked too much. Have you forgotten our vows? You know <br/>the trouble this could get you into.<p/>
6632	<title name='Altam'/>Captain Avelin, we don't have to reveal everything about ourselves. <br/>We can win this war if the Milletian fights at our side. We should <br/>at least try...<p/>
6633	<title name='Avelin'/>The rules are not open to your interpretation, Altam. You know <br/>what the punishments are!<p/>
6634	<title name='Altam'/>Y-you're right, but still...<p/>
6635	<title name='Altam'/>Oh, hey! Milletian! You came for me!<p/>
6636	<title name='Avelin'/>Altam! Did you already say everything?!<p/>
6637	<title name='Tarlach'/>Caring about worldly things caused me nothing but pain. I longed <br/>for the restful peace of Sidhe Sneachta...<p/>
6638	<title name='Tarlach'/>But then you moved my heart and gave me the courage to take <br/>action again...<p/>
6639	<title name='Rian'/>In the end...What were you able to protect?<p/>
6640	<title name='Ruairi'/>Why continue, when only despair awaits us in the end?<p/>
6641	<title name='Ruairi'/>But you showed me that anything can be overcome. I wanted to <br/>be like you...<p/>
6642	<title name='Elatha'/>Humans took alchemy from the Fomors and used it against each <br/>other. What would they do with the power of a demigod?<p/>
6643	<title name='Shylock'/>With power like that, you could make a better world!<p/>
6644	<title name='Eirawen'/>We never would have made it this far without you. I can't thank <br/>you enough. <p/>
6645	<title name='Eavan && Aodhan'/>I want to thank you for coming to this world.<p/>
6646	<title name='Duncan'/>The moment I saw you, I knew you would be a great hero. <br/>The spark in your eyes...<p/>
6647	<title name='Nao'/>What do you want to do in this world?<p/>
6648	<title name='Black Wizard'/>Impressive... you withstood the sloppy attempt to meld <br/>your power with that of our supreme being. You are lucky.<p/>
6649	<title name='Black Wizard'/>Still, power without a leash has a way of biting its owner...<p/>
6650	<title name='Black Wizard'/>When that power finds its way, the world will face a <br/>rebirth of its own.<p/>
6651	...and <username/>
6652	Blackbone Dragon\nHades of Abyss
6653	Celestial Unicorn
6654	Celestial Unicorn
6655	<title name='Avelin'/>They weren't that tough.<p/>
6656	<title name='Altam'/>Yeah! And it's all thanks to <username/>!<p/>
6657	<title name='Avelin'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>We'll continue with the investigation. You stand guard.<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>I don't sense anything dangerous right now.<br/>Altam, <username/>. Take turns standing watch.<p/>
6658	Both of you! Step aside!
6659	<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>What the...?! I sense the power of an Apostle,<br/>but it's unlike anything we've seen yet!<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>I couldn't even sense it until it appeared!<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>...<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>...We'll give this thing the same treatment<br/>we've given to the other Apostles!<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>Both of you, stay in formation!<p/>
6660	<title name='Avelin'/><username/>, prepare the defenses!<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>Altam, prepare for binding!<p/>
6661	<title name='Avelin'/>Altam! Now!<p/>
6662	<title name='Avelin'/>Unbelievable...!<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>If we give up now, everyone at<br/>Qilla Base Camp will be in serious danger.<p/>\n					<title name='Avelin'/>We need to lure it away.<p/>
6663	<title name='Pihne'/>Sorry to keep you waiting! Have you been here long?<p/>
6664	<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>Pihne!<p/>
6665	<npcportrait name='pihne'/><title name='Pihne'/>Avelin! I missed you!<p/>
6666	<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>You're looking healthy as usual, Pihne.<p/>
6667	<npcportrait name='pihne'/><title name='Pihne'/>Really? I've been overwhelmed by all these missions!<br/>I feel like I need ten people to help me!<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='pihne'/><title name='Pihne'/>Oh, I also heard the Prophets invaded Avalon Gate!<br/>At least that's what I heard. It's hard to believe, though.<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='pihne'/><title name='Pihne'/>And there's an Apostle that's immune to Crusader Skills?<br/>That must've been tough for the Arthuan Unit.<p/>
6668	<npcportrait name='torvish'/><title name='Talvish'/>This is why all the generals have gathered here.<p/>
6669	<npcportrait name='torvish'/><title name='Talvish'/>And I also want you all to know that<br/><username/> will be joining us this time.<p/>
6670	<title name='Pihne'/>Oh! You must be...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>I'm sorry! I didn't even introduce myself!<br/>I'm Pihne, general of the Eiler Unit.<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>Sorry if I seem a little nervous. This is my first time<br/>being close to you and everything.<p/>
6671	<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>Pihne, please don't turn into another Altam.<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>Altam is a little TOO fond of <username/>...<br/>He always runs off to <username/> without my permission!<p/>
6672	<npcportrait name='pihne'/><title name='Pihne'/>Oh, Altam! I'm sure that must be frustrating for you, Avelin.<br/>But don't be too hard on him!<p/>
6673	<npcportrait name='aveline'/><title name='Avelin'/>You don't even know the half of it...<p/>
6674	Altam!
6675	<title name='Pihne'/>Are you hurt, Altam?<p/>
6676	<title name='Altam'/>Thank you, Pihne!<p/>
6677	<title name='Talvish'/>There are no graveyards nearby. Where could it have come from?<br/>And that report from Iria is suspicious...<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>I thought we'd have time to relax, but I guess not.<p/>
6678	<title name='Pihne'/>There's a whole bunch of them now!<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>Maybe they followed me all the way here!<p/>
6679	<title name='<username/>'/>(Caswyn seems to be asleep...)<p/>\n					<title name='<username/>'/>(...)<p/>\n					<title name='<username/>'/>(...)<p/>\n					<title name='<username/>'/>(You should wake him up.)<p/>
6680	<title name='Caswyn'/>...I wasn't sleeping.<p/>
6681	<npcportrait name='caswyn'/><title name='Caswyn'/>I knew you'd come.<p/>\n					<npcportrait name='caswyn'/><title name='Caswyn'/>That's why I hid in a place where even Pihne wouldn't find me.<p/>
6682	<title name='Caswyn'/>I wanted it to be just you and me.<p/>
6683	<title name='Pihne'/>If I kill myself right here and now, then I won't become an Apostle...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>But... I'm too afraid to die.<p/>
6684	<title name='Pihne'/>From the very beginning...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>...I was always a coward.<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>I've been pretending the whole time...<br/>Pretending to be a holy knight...<p/>
6685	<title name='Pihne'/>But none of that matters anymore.<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>I'll turn into an Apostle soon enough...<p/>
6686	<title name='Caswyn'/>Enough, Pihne!<br/>You are not turning into an Apostle!<p/>\n					<title name='Caswyn'/>Now let's head back. Everyone's waiting for you...<p/>
6687	<title name='Pihne'/>I'm so sorry...<br/>I can't hear anything you're saying...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>The voices in my head are so full of hate...<br/>They're getting louder... They won't stop...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>I can't hear anything but the voices!<p/>
6688	Pihne!
6689	<title name='Pihne'/>Caswyn...<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>It's meaningless now...<br/>But I've been wanting to tell you this.<p/>\n					<title name='Pihne'/>Caswyn, I...<br/>I've always...<p/>
6690	<title name='Caswyn'/>...?<p/>\n					<title name='Caswyn'/>No...<p/>\n					<title name='Caswyn'/>There's no way...<br/>Pihne...<p/>\n					<title name='Caswyn'/>I won't let this happen to you!<p/>
6691	<title name='Pennar'/><username/>.<p/>\n					<title name='Pennar'/>You probably can't even stand.<p/>\n					<title name='Pennar'/>I was hoping we could have a proper battle,<br/>but I guess not. What a shame.<p/>\n					<title name='Pennar'/>Believe it or not, I place a high value on honor.<p/>
6692	<title name='Talvish'/>Ugh... Caswyn saved me from a mortal blow.<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>I knew I could count on him...<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>...<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>So, it's happening to you again, <username/>.<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>People will call you a hero and even deify you,<br/>yet you always end up alone on the battlefield.<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>As for me...<br/>I'll be by your side until the bitter end.<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>Don't carry the weight of the world on your shoulders alone.<p/>\n					<title name='Talvish'/>I'll be there with you no matter what.<p/>
6693	<title name='Talvish'/>The battle seems to be over for now.<br/>But where did the Prophets disappear to?<p/>
6694	<title name='Talvish'/>We must find them and heighten our defenses<br/>before they breach the gate.<p/>
6695	<title name='Black Wizard'/>Everything has unfolded just as it was planned.<p/>

6709	<title name='Laighlinne'/><autopass duration='2500'/>We are already banished to hell.
6710	<title name='Laighlinne'/><autopass duration='2500'/>We must accept our fate.
6711	<title name='Laighlinne'/><autopass duration='4500'/>Besides... some of the boats made it to Erinn.

6718	<title name='Sera'/><autopass duration='2200'/>I will do what must be done.
6719	...and <username/>.
6720	No wind today.
6721	Grandfather put me in charge of the third fleet. 
6722	It is a great honor. A great opportunity.
6723	The journey to Erinn will take us to paradise.
6724	Everyone on board is in great spirits.
6725	We're all expecting a wonderful new land. \nSomewhere we can finally have peace.
6726	A little boy asked me to serenade the ship today for luck.
6727	It was the best song I've ever performed. I've never been so happy to share my gift.
6728	Cloudy, light winds.
6729	Father led the rebellion against grandfather.
6730	Grandfather's fleets are gone. Wiped out.
6731	He's gone now, \nbut I know he can't rest. \nNot without realizing his dream of seeing Erinn.
6732	If I had told him before...  If I had been able to warn him about father...\nhe'd still be here...
6733	But how could I?
6734	How was I supposed to choose between them?
6735	Storming.
6736	Father was furious that I tried to stop his rebellion. 
6737	Even so, I didn't think he would abandon us. \nNot like this.
6738	One moment the entire fleet was caught in the storm, the next they were all gone and we were alone. \nHe must have planned it in advance. \nHe took our maps. He took our compasses. 
6739	He left us here to die.
6740	Rain.
6741	We're living on rainwater for now, but it won't last.
6742	As soon as the food goes, so do we.
6743	The crew was holding together, but they all know. \nOur end is coming and there's nothing we can do
6744	The music stopped days ago. \nThere's only silence now and it gets heavier by the hour.
6745	Clear.
6746	The little boy that loved my music passed away today. 
6747	He was nothing but bones. Just like the rest of them. Just like me.
6748	People are stealing. One of the crewmen killed his bunkmate. \nThe fear has set in. They're starving and desperate.
6749	I am convinced we have stumbled into hell. \nWhat other explanation can there be?
6750	I betrayed my own father. Maybe it is right that I waste away into nothing. \nIf only I could spare these people my punishment.
6751	I wish you could hear me, grandfather. I wish you would save them from me...

7001	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3000'/>A few cuts and scrapes, but nothing major.<br/>Thankfully, the Milletian also seems unharmed.

7004	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='embarrass'/><autopass duration='3000'/>...! R-right. Caught off guard like we were, I didn't quite connect all the dots.
7005	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='serious'/><autopass duration='3000'/>The warband that abducted me was much the same as this.

7029	There it is, on an island in the lake!
7030	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='3000'/>It seems we were right to have a look around.<br/>I sensed something odd, and indeed, it's them.
7031	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Miserable curs... How DARE you destroy the monolith!<br/>They're ruining our plan!
7032	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='3000'/>It wasn't perfect. No plan truly is. And in truth,<br/>it was meant to be undertaken by someone else. Not by me.
7033	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that these three are stronger than we expected.<br/>They sundered the monolith's defenses with seeming ease...
7034	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='4200'/>There was little else to be done. The time to act is now.<br/>It fell to me to find other officers like you and commence the first night.
7035	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>I was able to set things in motion, but...things are quickly spiraling<br/>out of my control. We MUST stop them before things grow even worse!
7036	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Cethlenn. Do you think them capable of passing your test?
7037	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='4000'/>The memory that only those who command the power of Briogh may overcome?<br/>Haha. I was told that even among the generals, it is a rare thing to manifest that power.
7038	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='3000'/>That may be the case, but...
7039	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3000'/>...I find it prudent to be more...diligent in matters of defense.
7040	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Haha. I leave the details to your discretion, then.<br/>It seems it's true what they say...that all you do, you do for his sake.
7041	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='4000'/>You're an interesting one to watch...regardless of where your allegiance lies.
7042	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>...Do you hope to destroy the evil stone?
7043	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='embarrass'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Oh dear. Now she's t-talking...
7044	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='concentrate'/><autopass duration='4000'/>It looks like a young girl now!<br/>And she seems like she has something to say...
7045	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>People with black robes came here and left this thing.<br/>I could feel there was something bad about it, so I hid it...
7046	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>But suddenly...everything went dark... Painful memories came flooding back.<br/>Thanks to you, I could wake from the nightmare.
7047	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>But I don't have the energy to appear like this much longer...<br/>Hiding the stone... It took too much from me.
7048	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>I will give you the key. But I ask that you please do me a favor.<br/>Don't worry, it is a simple request...
7049	<title name='NONE'/><autopass duration='3000'/>(The voice of the young ghost begins to fade even as she speaks.)
7050	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Please deliver a message to my brother...that Arranz is fine now...<br/>Tell him to be free from the memories of pain. The sorrow...
7051	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Tell him thank you. That I'm sorry, and...that I really miss him.
7052	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>*sniff*... There's so much more I wish I could say, but not enough time to say it, alas.
7053	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Thank you for your help. When you see my brother, please give him my message...
7054	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>And... Do be careful with that key.
7055	<title name='Ghost Girl'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Someone... Has locked away awful, painful memories within...
7056	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='2500'/>Sh-Sheena...?
7057	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='fear'/><autopass duration='2500'/>No... Sheena!
7058	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Are you okay? It's me, Piran. Wake up...!
7059	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='embarrass'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Is she all right? Did we make it in time?
7060	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='fear'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Is that...Balor of the Evil Eye? But why is he in chains?
7061	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='3000'/>It's like he can't tell friend from foe. This feels...wrong, somehow.<br/>Did something happen with the ritual?
7062	<title name='???'/><autopass duration='2000'/>...Curious, are we?
7063	<title name='Fomor Warrior'/><autopass duration='3500'/>You...! What is this treachery?! We were told he would live again if we followed your commands!
7064	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3000'/>And so he lives! I am nothing if not a man of my word.
7065	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='smile'/><autopass duration='4000'/>I'm not sure what the problem is.<br/>Or...are you saying it's too much for your tiny brain to grasp?
7066	<title name='Fomor Warrior'/><autopass duration='4000'/>The problem, snake, is that THAT is not Balor!
7067	<title name='Fomor Warrior'/><autopass duration='4500'/>In flesh he may be King Balor, but not in mind, for he does not<br/>recognize his own! All he did in life, he did for the Fomors!
7068	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='3500'/>He did it all...for you? Aha...hahaha...
7069	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='mad'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Fool. He was simply savoring the frenzy of the fight. You mistook bloodlust for genuine concern.
7070	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='5000'/>You begged me to revive the Balor of old, and I have done exactly that.<br/>So I ask you again: what is the problem?
7071	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='smile'/><autopass duration='5500'/>Dear me. How can I explain to such a witless imbecile?<br/>I'm already grossly oversimplifying it for you.
7072	<title name='Fomor Warrior'/><autopass duration='2500'/>You...!
7073	<title name='Fomor Warrior'/><autopass duration='3500'/>How DARE you deceive us with this false Balor! There shall be no quarter for you!
7074	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Vayne...?! Why on earth...?
7075	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Vayne! Thank goodness you're here!<br/>They're the ones! The people who--
7076	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='4000'/>...Finally. What took you so long?
7077	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3000'/>...
7078	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3500'/>You're done faffing about, then?
7079	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='3500'/>Even after all this time, your 'hobby' strikes me as no less strange.
7080	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='ignore'/><autopass duration='3000'/>I'll not be lectured by a disrespectful subordinate<br/>who blatantly acted without the approval of his commander.
7081	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Do you intend to make me a laughingstock among the generals?
7082	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='5000'/>I wished to see how you would perform in a commanding role, but if<br/>all you have for me is self-important reproach, I am sorely disappointed.
7083	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='4000'/>...How distasteful. It brings a flood of unpleasant memories rushing to the fore.
7084	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='surprise'/><autopass duration='2500'/>Vayne? Why...?
7085	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='fear'/><autopass duration='3500'/>Those people persecuted the followers of Hymerark!
7086	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='3500'/>Then the subordinate you've been looking for all this time... Is it really...?
7087	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='serious'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Piran. Stop. That man is no friend of ours.
7088	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>I smelled a rat from the very beginning. I cannot believe<br/>I actually trusted you, even for a second!
7089	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='smile'/><autopass duration='4000'/>It seems I have a rare talent for infuriating those around me. For what<br/>it's worth, I actually enjoyed the time I spent with the three of you.
7090	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='4500'/>A more wretched pastime I can scarcely imagine. Could you not spare<br/>a thought for me, who had to follow you around like some furtive cutpurse?
7091	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='3500'/>...I can't believe it.
7092	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='3500'/>Are you the one who did this to my sister, then?
7093	<title name='Piran'/><npcportrait name='pirran'/><face name='cry'/><autopass duration='3500'/>Why would you hurt a fragile, innocent little girl?<br/>What did we ever do, that you would hate us so?
7094	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='mad'/><autopass duration='4000'/>You'll have to ask those dimwitted Fomors. They demanded nothing less,<br/>and let me tell you, it wasn't easy to give them what they asked for.
7095	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='mad'/><autopass duration='4000'/>Pale, milky-white skin and eyes of the deepest red...<br/>It is no simple task to find one who fits that description.
7096	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='smile'/><autopass duration='6000'/>Had it not been written in the Revelations, I would never have gone to those lengths.<br/>The Fomors may be a clueless lot who cannot even recognize their king, but I suppose<br/>I can at least admire the spirit of their loyalty.
7097	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Stop this, right now!
7098	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='3000'/><username/>, they're responsible for everything we've been fighting against!
7099	<title name='Marleid'/><npcportrait name='mared'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Who ARE you people? Why are you doing this?! You're not even Fomors!
7100	Balor Reborn
7101	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='4000'/>...There are many things I wish to ask, but I doubt you'd give me any clear answers even if I did.
7102	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='ignore'/><autopass duration='3000'/>How cold of you. Are your expectations of me truly so low?
7103	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3000'/>Do you really not understand...?!
7104	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry2'/><autopass duration='3500'/>I could scarcely believe it when I saw you defend that lot in Belvast. But I figured<br/>there must be SOME reason you would deign to pass your hours with those fools.
7105	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='3500'/>But...why, WHY, would you bestow that power upon the Milletian?<br/>Did we not reach an agreement to further deliberate the matter? 
7106	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='angry'/><autopass duration='4500'/>It boggles my mind why -he- would show his favor to one as reckless as you.<br/>Your actions could very well have compromised our greater goal!
7107	<title name='Cethlenn'/><npcportrait name='cethlenn'/><face name='normal'/><autopass duration='5500'/>Sera emphasized that Milletians are too dangerous. Even the Revelations make no mention of them.<br/>History chronicles the fact of their presence, but all concrete records surrounding them slip away, lost to time.
7108	<title name='Vayne'/><npcportrait name='bein'/><face name='happy'/><autopass duration='4300'/>Isn't that at the heart of what makes the Milletian so fascinating, though?<br/>One whose influence is felt everywhere, yet truly belongs nowhere...
