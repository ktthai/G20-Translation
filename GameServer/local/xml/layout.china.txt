325	Humans are blessed with versatility. Their skills are spread evenly between Stamina and Intelligence, and they possess a variety of skills. Humans are well-versed in close-ranged combat but can also learn to effectively wield a bow as well. Once they master their combat skills, Humans can excel at whatever style of combat they desire.
326	Elves are innately skilled at archery and move more quickly than Humans and Giants. They also possess high Intelligence and MP. Elves primarily wield bows and magic, allowing them to attack from a distance. Since Elves can perform long-ranged attacks at a younger age than other races, they have a slight advantage over Humans and Giants.
327	Giants are tall, brawny, and exceptionally strong. They are able to handle powerful weapons that no other race can wield. They are capable melee fighters. Even young, unlearned Giants can hold their own in close quarters combat.

2137	The race of choice for many, due to their versatility.\nTheir growth is well-rounded, making for balanced heroes.\nLike Giants, Humans can dual-wield, though Humans dual-wield one-handed swords. After mastering their combat skills, Humans are proficient at all styles of combat.
2138	Elves are fleet of foot, and skilled archers. Their basic bow attacks\nloose two arrows at once, and they're famous for shooting while mounted.\nThey also possess a high Intelligence and MP. These traits mean\nElves are primarily ranged fighters, using bows and magic to attack targets.
2139	Giants are tall, brawny, and strong enough to wield heavier weaponry than other races. They're capable melee fighters. Even young Giants are formidable in close-quarters combat. Giants can wield some blunt weapons, and even carry a two-handed weapon in a single hand.
