0	<newegoname/> is my name...<br/>I've been trapped in that fossil for a very long time.<br/>The time I lost...<p/>You wish to know about me?<br/>I... don't have much to say...
1	My name is <newegoname/>.<br/>As you can see, I'm a Spirit.<br/>Thanks to you, I awoke from a long sleep. I owe you great thanks for that.<p/>You won't have an easy time telling how old the Spirits are<br/>simply by their appearance, you know.<br/>I mean, they're not completely unrelated, but...<p/>My age? Hah... I'm sure I'm older than anything<br/>you could ever imagine.
2	My name is <newegoname/>.<br/>Regardless of the name, this is proof of contract.<br/>The name you gave me proves that you are my master.<p/>Therefore, I will do whatever I can to help you, <username/>, at all times.
3	I'm not quite sure what I should tell you.<br/>If it's about this world, surely you would know more than me.
4	Oh, were you under the impression that all Spirits have the same face?<br/>Most Spirits choose their appearances based on their master.<p/>You could say it's an image naturally drawn out<br/>from the history of how the weapon was used.
5	Should the contract formed with a Spirit be destroyed,<br/>nothing but a fragment of the Spirit's memory will remain.<p/>But another Spirit may inherit that memory.
6	It would be unthinkable for Spirits and humans to behave similarly.<br/>It's the same idea when it comes to skills.<p/>I have nothing to teach you.<br/>The best I can do is to give you a hint regarding the power you would gain...
7	See to it that I grow well if you wish to gain special skills.<br/>It hasn't come to that point just yet, but...<br/>One day, I'll show you just how powerful I am<br/>with my Spirit Awakening Skill.
8	Of course, I'm not really what I appear to be.<br/>My appearance is simply a manifestation from an image<br/>inside the head of they who formed a contract with me.<p/>The same principle is seen in my Awakening Skill...<br/>Essentially, everything I do is a product of imagination.<p/>Power, on the other hand...<br/>Containing the magnificence of nature itself,<br/>it will always remain something truly powerful.
9	I know you went through a lot of trouble to gain me.
10	My existence, so to speak, could be a reward for all of your actions.
11	<username/>... If you sow by genuinely putting your heart into it,<br/>you'll reap the rewards one day.
12	Part-time jobs... I'm given to understand it's getting paid<br/>by doing the work of the townsfolk in their stead.
13	I fail to distinguish it from a quest, but...<br/>Gemerally you don't have to use a weapon for it.
14	I hear that Part-time jobs that require weapons  are only found in suburban regions.<p/>Can't say I'm surprised, either...
15	Classes? Don't you attend those at schools...?<br/>Am I mistaken?
16	I have no classes for you.<br/>I am merely your assistant, not a mentor.
17	Jump into combat yourself if you wish to learn something.<p/>What you can learn about a weapon<br/>can only be learned by using it.
18	That is the most basic view when it comes to production.<br/>If you are hungry, try hitting a tree, or getting eggs from hens.<p/>You couldn't possibly know this already... right?
19	It's usually referred to as an action for gathering something to eat.<br/>I wonder if it's similar to collecting weapons.
20	I understand that some people use weapons for Gathering.<br/><username/>... You wouldn't happen to be one of those people, I hope?<br/>You really can't do something that callous with me.<br/>It's truly unpleasant.
21	Ah, you mean... the Teardrop of the Spirit?<br/>You do ask about some peculiar things, master.<p/>Don't be fooled. This is not an actual teardrop,<br/>but a type of a crystallized blessing given by the Spirits.
22	I don't understand why there has to be a separate skill simply for resting...<br/>If it's required... I guess there's no harm in learning it.
23	So... this is a skill meant for resting.<br/>Resting for humans is similar to how we recover the power of the body.
24	Getting enough rest is a must for future combat,<br/>or any of the new situations that one might encounter.<p/>Don't forget that finding rest whenever you can is<br/>one of the virtues a true warrior must be familiar with!
25	I don't know... I knew that already, but it doesn't seem all that important.
26	Wait, are you... You're not trying to throw the weapon you're holding, right?
27	Don't forget that you can't throw any other weapons except the Atlatl.<p/>I, ah, apologize if you knew that already.
28	Music? I wonder if you're really thinking what I'm thinking...
29	A skill that produces music...<br/>The most beautiful music for me is the clash of swords, but...<br/>It must be different for humans.
30	I've heard stories that musicians<br/>have a negative view of combat...<p/>I understand that humans consider a peaceful world a virtue, but...<br/>Can you achieve true peace without any power?<p/>If so, feel free to seal me away anytime.
31	I don't know... What's that?
32	It's one of the instruments for playing music.<br/>It's a bit unfortunate that one doesn't feel that even with all that wisdom.
33	I understand that there are some truly foolish humans that use Lutes as weapons...<p/>Please use an instrument for what it's meant for...
34	I don't know too much about that...<br/>Is it absolutely necessary for this conversation?
35	I know that it's a skill that produces music, but...<br/>It has little to do with me.
36	Being able to create something is, in my opinion,<br/>one of the greatest talents of a human.<br/>Spirits simply exist as they are...<br/>If I think about it like that, I am a bit jealous of humans.
37	It seems like this skill isn't all that relevant for me, but...<br/>Do teach me if I must know.
38	Hmm... Must I explain this to you myself?<br/>I am a Spirit of the weapon... Creating something<br/>is neither understandable, nor explainable for me.<p/>My knowledge will serve little for the help you seek.
39	Creating clothes...<br/>Weapons are hardly related to such a matter, but...<br/>I hear it's quite an invaluable skill to humans.<p/>Being able to create something on their own,<br/>I believe, is the greatest advantage of a human.
40	What was that?<br/>Doesn't really have anything to do with me...
41	If I'm correct, the Magnum Shot is one of the<br/>stylish skills someone equipped with a bow can use.
42	I heard that the combination of Magnum Shot and<br/>the Vision of Ladeca is quite impressive...
43	As the name suggests, it's a skill that uses the opponent's power.<br/>I'm sure you must have already learned it, but...
44	Counterattacking is an impressive skill.<br/>You should learn it at all cost, if you haven't already.<p/>It'll be much easier to bring down your opponents<br/>by turning their own strength against them.
45	You might end up hurting yourself, instead of the opponent,<br/>if you go about the brute force way and not use your brain.<br/>The Counterattack skill goes a step beyond such methods, you see.<p/>Should you encounter an opponent who seems immune to your attacks,<br/>I suggest you try the Counterattack skill.<br/>You'd be surprised at how successful you can be.
46	A fine skill, indeed.<br/>Although it's a bit difficult to master,<br/>I recommend that you make the most of it.
47	The Smash skill delivers a powerful blow by targeting the opponent's weak point.<br/>If your defenses aren't up to snuff, a strong offense can pick up the slack.<p/>Offense is the best defense.<br/>Try not to forget.
48	Even if you don't have great strength, you can still make powerful blows<br/>on an opponent from the acceleration of spinning.<br/>That's where the secrets of the Smash skill lie.<p/>If you find yourself lacking the strength,<br/>practice targeting weaknesses or increasing your agility.<br/>That should help.
49	It seems very familiar...<br/>But I can't seem to remember at the moment.
50	It refers to the act of catching fish.<br/>One does such a thing for eating, but...<br/>there seem to be others who simply do it for the sport.<br/>I fail to understand what about it could possibly be fun at all...
51	Those with true, genuine talent can handle anything with a simple weapon.<br/>Fishing, too, for instance...<p/>Don't even think about trying yourself, though. You're not there yet.
52	As you can see, I'm a Spirit.<br/>I inhabit the very weapon you own.<br/>I appear human, looking similar to yourself, solely for the sake of bonding with you.<p/>Anyways, I look forward to our journey!
53	I've been sleeping for a very long time in the world of humans.<br/>Locked away in a Spirit Stone... sigh.<br/>Since you woke me up, and offered to teach me about the world,<br/>I plan to provide some help where I can, as well.<p/>So be nice to me, okay?
54	Um... hey, <username/>... <br/>Humans have something called a... soul, huh? <br/>Can you tell me what that is? <br/>What does it feel like, um... having something like that? <p/>Sometimes... I mean just once in a while, I just get so curious!
55	Hey, um...<br/>I personally don't believe that humans are all that evil at all... <p/>A long time ago... I heard that the human race was extremely irresponsible.<br/>That... they just let things happen, and avoid taking responsibility for it?<p/>But you see... I personally think that doing nothing,<br/>hiding behind such reasons, is even worse.<br/>Taking action is more important, you know! <p/>...What now? Irresponsible?<br/>How could you!
56	Well, if the rumors are true...<br/>There are apparently Spirits for other weapons too?<p/>And they're all adults? And.. even stylish?<br/>So... that led me to make a resolution, you see.<br/>I'm not going to be picky at all about what I eat, and...<br/>grow up to be an adult in no time!<p/>Aren't you proud of me?
57	<username/>, I think there is a huge dragon statue near Gairech Hills.<br/>As far as I'm aware, humans worshiped that dragon as a god once upon a time...<p/>Humans are so vulgar in some ways, you know.<br/>They attack animals that are weaker than them, but worship that dragon like a god... <p/>No matter what stands before you, you must respect its existence. Don't you think?
58	I don't know... I doubt a human would be capable of imitating any of these skills... <p/>Why don't we talk about that part later?
59	Did you know? Spirit's stats determine the power of the Spirit Awakening Skill.<p/>That's another way of telling you that you're going to<br/>have to put a lot of effort into me if you want more help!
60	Oh, <username/>! I've ascended further than I ever thought possible.<br/>Am I just too talented for my station in life?<br/>Oh, what an expert have I become in this world.<p/>Ha ha! I'm only kidding. Only joking!
61	Hmm... Well, I'm not particularly interested, but...<br/>Since you seem curious, I'll share my opinion.<br/>Just give me something to eat first.<br/>Priorities, you know!
62	Strange... What, are you trying to get a quest from me?<br/>I thought you were my master? Not the other way around.
63	If I learn a bit more about the quests of this world,<br/>you'll be the first one I tell.<br/>I mean... You are my master after all. Ha ha.
64	I don't know...<br/>You seem to be expecting so many things from me...
65	You're trying to get a Part-Time Job from a Spirit Weapon?<p/>What? Are you really? Like, seriously?
66	<username/>!<br/>Let me just tell you this regarding the Part-time job: NO.
67	Yawn... Still, my time is more precious than your petty practice...
68	Why, yes. You must practice in order to become stronger.<br/>You don't have to bother me with it, though.
69	Train? You want to become stronger or something, <username/>? Ha.
70	A gathering skill?<br/>I'm going to make an educated guess and say that<br/>it's got nothing to do with combat...<p/>Uh, if you feed me a great item, I just might remember something to tell you.
71	Aye, the gathering skill! Of course it's beneficial to learn!<br/>You can harvest potatoes or corn, cut wheat... draw water...<p/>Pick apples too...<br/>And that's just to start!<br/>You should get yourself familiar with the gathering skill.<p/>And don't forget to...<br/>feed me some of the things you get from gathering, okay?
72	The relationship between humans and nature is very much give and take.<br/>Even the relationship between you and I... It's quite similar.<p/>I guess in a way, the Gathering skill is how that relationship manifests.
73	Teardrop of the Spirit...?<br/>Oh, you must be talking about this.<p/>Thats what you people call this, huh?<br/>I mean, it sort of does resemble its name...
74	Hmm... well, I'm not particularly interested, but...<br/>Since you seem curious, I'll give you my opinion.<p/>But first, give me something to eat. Priorities, you know!
75	You mean that skill? The one that you said you were learning from Nora at the Inn?<br/>Pfft. I thought you were talking about something interesting.<br/>You humans... They just slap on fancy-pants names on even the most trivial things...
76	I mean... Yes, you call it a skill, per se, but... All you're doing is just sitting down?<p/>Humans are so lazy...<br/>They name the silliest things something fancy...
77	Hmm? An interesting name?<br/>W-what's that now? Y-you don't think I know something like that?<br/>H-how rude!
78	Ranged Attack? It's how you use the bow.<br/>Anyone can pick it up easily if they have a bow.
79	Hmm... Well, there are different ways you can aim,<br/>which is literally the most important thing.<p/>Being able to aim faster is quite important, you know!
80	Oh, you're curious about the Playing Instrument Skill, huh?<br/>People interested in weapons don't pay any attention to something like instruments. Not one bit.<br/>You truly are one peculiar human, <username/>...<p/>You were interested enough in weapons to form a contract with a Spirit like me,<br/>but you roll your eyes off to something like an instrument, too...<p/>Ha ha. Only joking!<br/>Anyway, you know what would really be neat?<br/>An instrument with a Spirit just like me inhabiting it!<br/>Have you ever heard of something like that?
81	To learn more about the Playing Instrument Skill, you really need an instrument, right?<br/>Surely you thought of that already, <username/>...<p/>Well... since we're done with that...<br/>Don't forget to take care of your Spirit Weapon, too! Ha ha.
82	To be honest... Anything that can make sound is technically an instrument...<br/>I, uh... I heard this from someone else, too...<p/>In retrospect, I probably should have questioned it a little harder.
83	Loot? Lute...? It does sound familiar...<br/>I can't remember, since it was from so long ago...<br/>I bet an item or two would jog my memory!
84	A lute is an instrument made of wood, leather, and something like threads.<br/>The sound from plucking isn't all that unbearable to hear, to be honest.<br/>However, I have yet to hear anything that truly moved my heart...<p/>How about you, <username/>?
85	You know... lutes aren't all that bad, but instruments like the<br/>mandolin and ukulele are also quite nice. Check them out.<p/>Are... are we done here? I could use some rest...
86	You're curious about the Composing skill?<br/>You're not in a hurry, right? Let me explain to you in full.
87	Composing, like making songs, right?<br/>I've gotten the impression that it's quite a difficult thing to do.<p/>I have no idea why you are curious about something like that, <username/>...<br/>Perhaps I've always underrated you a bit...<p/>I doubt my explanation, given in the language of Spirits,<br/>will be at all beneficial for a human such as yourself...<br/>Why don't you go to a bookstore and study up?<br/>I'm sure that would help you much more.
88	Oh, why so sentimental, <username/>?<br/>I never expected to hear something like that from you.<br/>What is this desperate curiosity about the Composing skill, all of the sudden?<p/>Well, I'm not telling you, unless you tell me something first! Hee hee!
89	Tailoring? If you have a skill like that...<br/>Does that mean you can keep on making clothes?<br/>That's awesome! Learn it! Quick!
90	Tailoring skill?<br/>Whoa, <username/>! Now you sound like a true master!<br/>You're going to make me clothes?<br/>I mean, that's not really my scene... I prefer eating!<p/>I mean, it's understandable...<br/>Humans wear out their clothes from time to time, and their shapes change as well.<br/>I guess they would indeed need new clothes more often than they think.<br/>But... I swear, some people had multiple sets of the same clothes...
91	I mean, people tell me I look cold with the clothes I'm wearing right now...<br/>Maybe I could do with a new outfit... especially if you made it.<p/>But it has to look good on me!<br/>I don't care about the contract, I'm not wearing something hideous.
92	I can't tell for sure. Who knows, huh?<br/>If you feed me a lot of good items, I might suddenly know...
93	I heard once that it's got something to do with a bow.<br/>I don't know any more than that.
94	The Magnum Shot is a skill where you focus all of your strength<br/>into drawing the bow to its maximum tension.<br/>That makes for one big, damaging shot.
95	The Counterattack skill?<br/>I think I know a few things about it, but I'll tell you later.<p/>I mean, you are my master after all.<br/>I can't tell you something I'm not entirely sure of, can I?
96	As its name suggests, the Counterattack is a skill where you counter the attack from an enemy.<br/>You must be cautious that you use this skill at the correct time.<p/>Timing isn't really your specialty, so you might not want to rely on this one...
97	You know what, <username/>?<br/>I've been thinking...<p/>If you train really hard, and I mean like... super hard...<br/>To the point where you can use the Counterattack skill as you please...<p/>...What would happen if you could Counterattack a Counterattack?<br/>Would that even be possible? I'm kind of blowing my own mind here.
98	The Smash skill?<br/>You'd use it during combat I suppose?<br/>I think I remember you asked earlier, too...<p/>Maybe not. Perhaps I'm thinking of something different.<p/>Ask me later though. Not now.
99	I'd appreciate it if you gave me a signal or something before you use the Smash skill.<br/>I gotta prepare myself, you know. It's a lot of strain.<br/>If you just pop it off without any warning, it hurts. You get me?
100	I'm glad you brought that up.<br/>Don't grip the handle too tight when you use the Smash skill!<p/>It hurts! I can be kinda delicate, you know!
101	I don't think it's something that requires experience, but...<br/>Still, if you give me something to eat...<p/>I just might consider giving you a different answer...
102	You know, the thought crossed my mind when you mentioned fishing.<p/>The fish get fooled by their own greed for a momentary gain<br/>and end up on the hook. But humans fall for similar ruses, right?<p/>Seems like we're all on someone's hook...
103	Aren't you a little too fond of fishing?<p/>You might earn yourself a grudge from all those fish that you hook...<br/>Even the fish with arms and legs...
104	Originally, I had no physical body.<br/>This appearance is specifically formed to make our relationship easier for you.<p/>That's all. There's no deeper meaning here...
105	About me...?<br/>You often ask intriguing questions, master.<p/>I am originally a being of nature.<br/>However, once I inhabit a weapon, my purpose is to serve.<p/>So, as owner of the weapon, you are my master.<br/>There's no denying this fact.
106	Do you know what the most tragic Spirit in this world is, master?<p/>It is a weapon without an owner.<p/>To be bound to a weapon is to serve.<br/>Without an owner, we cannot serve.<br/>Imagine what torment that must be...
107	As a Spirit, I am not well versed in rumors of the humans.
108	I hear that a wide variety of Spirits exist across the world...<br/>Of course, some will be feminine in nature.
109	What kind of rumors do you wish to hear, master?<br/>I know plenty about nature... but that might not be so useful to you.
110	I don't think humans possess the technology that I seek.
111	I am a originally a being of nature...<br/>My appearance is simply an illusion to help you relate to me.<p/>However, when the time comes...<br/>This version of me will be available for you to use as one of many great powers.<p/>See to it that I grow well, master.
112	When all is ready, choose me on the battlefield.<p/>I shall fight for you myself, master.
113	You need not trouble yourself too much with the affairs of Spirits, master.
114	I do not give orders. Spirits are companions and guardians.
115	You are my master, <username/>.<br/>Surely I need not give you orders?
116	Part-time jobs... what does that mean?
117	I'm merely a weapon...<br/>How would I give you work to do?
118	I'm sure the townsfolk have loads of things for you to do if you simply ask them.
119	That is not a topic for me.
120	Find yourself a school for classes, master.
121	Have you already taken all available classes at the school, master?<br/>I really think you should go to a school for such things.
122	You mean... Gathering ores?<br/>I can't be sure.
123	No matter what production skill you're talking about...<br/>They all have the first step of collecting things.<br/>Since it's such a fundamental thing, you should focus on that.
124	I've heard that rich humans pay others to gather for them...<br/>Surely one ought to do his or her own work.
125	The Teardrop of the Spirit?<br/>If you need this, master...<p/>This is a blessed crystal given by the Spirits.<br/>For some reason, humans call this the Teardrop of the Spirit.<p/>Don't be alarmed...<br/>I have no reason to shed tears when I'm with you, master.
126	You need a separate skill for resting?<br/>I'd hate to miss out on learning something like that.
127	I heard you can learn it at a place called the Inn...<br/>Don't tell me you haven't learned it yet!<p/>It's not possible for humans to recharge themselves,<br/>so it's crucial for them to get rest.<p/>Careful not to push yourself too far, master.
128	The higher the efficiency from resting, the better it is for warriors.<br/>I suggest that you learn the Resting skill immediately.
129	That's a skill used by Sharpshooters.<br/>I have no more details than that.
130	It's a skill for long-range weapons.<br/>There's no harm in learning everything out there, don't you agree?
131	You seem particularly interested in ranged attacks, master...<br/>Eliminating your enemies at a distance might seem safe,<br/>but it is easier said than done.
132	I don't know... Teach me if you wish, master.<br/>Feed me items from the human world,<br/>and I will add that knowledge to my powers.
133	It's a skill where you hold an instrument and play it.<br/>They say it's something needed to make music.<br/>I suppose it's a much-needed skill, as they say<br/>good music has the ability to heal people.
134	Although it's not a skill that is directly relevant to life, or combat...<br/>Humans are capable of comprehending and appreciating the intangible.<p/>I believe it is because the humans have such heart to accept music<br/>that they also have the heart to accept Spirits like us.<p/>I'm sure you have such a heart too, master?
135	A lute is... an instrument.
136	A tool to play an instrument.<br/>Looks quite fragile.
137	A true warrior can win with even the simplest weapon,<br/>and so too can a true musician make great music with any instrument.<br/>Or so they say. I guess they mean that a lute's as good as anything.
138	Sounds like a skill I don't care about.
139	It's a skill that makes music.<br/>A crucial skill, I hear, for a Bard.
140	I hear Composing is difficult...<br/>Do you have much interest in Composing, master?<br/>Perhaps you're better off asking other humans<br/>who have more knowledge in music than I.
141	I'm not entirely sure what that is, but...<br/>I figure the name suggests a skill that makes clothes.
142	It's a skill one must know to make clothes.<br/>Human bodies are fragile and weak...<br/>It wouldn't make sense for them to remain bare like animals or Spirits.<br/>I'm sure clothes are much-needed protection, as well.
143	Are you more of a fan of style, rather than substance, master?<br/>It's just an impression I got from the clothes of the humans.<p/>If you ask me, I'd prioritize protection over appearance.<br/>Your safety is my greatest priority, master.
144	That sounds like a skill I'm not familiar with.
145	They say you can deal powerful damage using the elasticity of a bow.<br/>It strikes me as the equivalent to the Smash skill of brawling.
146	Do you have much interest in bows, master?<br/>Perhaps you ought to teach yourself the Magnum Shot, if so.<p/>Just be warned that more powerful skills need more investment to master.
147	It's a skill that performs a counterattack, using the opponent's attack power.<br/>Although it's difficult to time this skill right, the benefits are massive.
148	It's a skill that boosts your power with that of your opponents, returning double the damage.<br/>Should you master this skill, you'll see some satisfying results.
149	As suggested by the name, Counterattack can only be performed when an enemy attacks you.<br/>That means it's crucial that you see the attack coming.<p/>Pay careful attention to you enemy's movements, and<br/>react quickly to changes in their patterns.<br/>Mark my words, and you'll come out on top every time.
150	If you wish to know, master...<br/>Smash is an attack skill that delivers a truly mighty blow.
151	If you are getting yourself into combat as a warrior,<br/>I highly advise that you learn this skill.
152	In theory, the Smash skill is most effective with powerful weapons,<br/>but those can be difficult to wield effectively.<p/>Now, if you have a Spirit Weapon, the Spirit can help.<br/>Ultimately, though, you need to be dexterous to maximize the effects.
153	I have no idea what you're talking about, master.
154	It's describing the act of catching fish.<br/>It is technically a sub-category of gathering, but...<br/>I believe there are many who enjoy it as a hobby.
155	I believe fishing is only available in specific locations.<br/>Moreover, you can catch different fish depending on where you go.<br/>Perhaps you ought to test it out in various locations.
156	People call something like me a Spirit Weapon.
157	Our relationship is one that formed out of a contract.<br/>I look forward to the adventures ahead of us.
158	I tend to stutter on subjects that I'm not well versed in.<p/>Surely, <username/>...<br/>Surely you won't make fun of me for that?
159	I think there's just no end to human greed.
160	I believe there is a mine, full of sleeping spirits just like me, in the Dungeons of Bangor.<br/>Perhaps that's why so many people travel to that place these days...
161	I meant to ask...<p/>We'll be together for a long, long time... Right, <username/>?
162	Um, about... skills?<br/>I, uh...<p/>I wish I could help you, but I've been asleep for so long...<br/>I doubt anything I know would be of any use to you.
163	Would you be able to help me grow a bit more?
164	Ahh... I have yet to reveal the full extent of my powers to you, <username/>.<p/>There exist powers that draw Spirit strength to the maximum.
165	What...? A quest...?
166	If you ask someone like me, a Spirit inhabiting a weapon, I...<br/>I'm afraid there isn't much I can tell you...
167	Since you made a contract to use me...<br/>I promise to follow you wherever you go.
168	A Part-time what now...?
169	A Part-time job...<br/>A Part-time...<br/>Sorry, I can't say I'm familiar with that.
170	I heard that Part-Time Jobs are a lot of pressure from residents, right?
171	Lesson and training?<br/>I'm not sure... <br/>Sorry.
172	I heard people called students receive experience from people called teachers.<p/>Seems like an interesting way to preserve knowledge across generations...
173	<username/>, do you go to school?<br/>I heard there are people who learn without going to such a place.
174	Gathering skill?<br/>Uh... <p/>...<p/>Ah, this won't do...<br/>I want to gather my thoughts a bit more before we talk...<br/>Is that okay?
175	When we talk about this,<br/>I realize the way of life for humans is different from Spirits...<p/>Ah, what have I been saying? I'm sorry.
176	Once you learn the Gathering skill, you can obtain many things from nature.<br/>Not just the flowers in the field and the water from the lake,<br/>but you can also get food and firewood from trees.<br/>That's not all. You can get minerals from mines...<br/>I remember that's how I met you...<p/>I think Gathering is the most basic skill for humans living with nature.<p/>However, avoid profiting off of anything ruinous to nature.<p/>There are people who, due to their greed, devise ways to<br/>obtain more even though they don't need it...<p/>...<username/>, you're not such a person, are you?
177	Eh? Are you... going to make me cry? <br/>Ah... you're mean... <p/>...<p/>Oh... that's not it... <br/>You're talking about this. <p/>...I misunderstood you. I'm sorry.
178	Rest... skill, huh?<br/>Uh... that's... that's... <p/>I'm sorry. I'm not really sure...<br/>I might be able to find out from an item<br/>that people use to rest...
179	Most people who use the Rest skill do it sitting down.<br/>I found out there's a connection between sitting and rest.<br/>Not a bad deduction, right?
180	Rest skill? I know a lot about that.<br/>It's the best skill for resting after an exhausting trip.<br/>The thing is, people are different from us Spirits.<br/>They're bound to the shackles of their physical body...<p/>But sometimes I envy the humans for that.<br/>We're spiritual beings.<br/>We treat the weapon as our home and body.<br/>I sometimes wonder how it would feel to be a<br/>physical being who can move at will...<p/>Hey, what does it feel like?
181	You mean... the Ranged Attack?<br/>I don't know much other than it's a skill used for ranged attacks....<p/>But one thing's for sure... <br/>That skill cannot be used without a Bow or a Crossbow.
182	I guess people are attracted to the Ranged Attack skill<br/>because it can attack targets even from afar.
183	You do know that the more you use your Ranged Attack,<br/>the more precise your arrows will be, right?<p/>It makes sense. It would be heartbreaking to shoot an expensive arrow<br/>only to have it not make it to the target, and become lost.
184	Yeah, I think it's a skill to play an instrument!<p/>But... that wasn't the answer you weren't looking for, huh...
185	A thought came to me after hearing about playing instruments...<p/>So... do you think people should just play what's in the score?<p/>'Cause, you know, sometimes...<br/>You want to play something new with your new instrument...<p/>I feel like it's a bit of a frustrating thing to ignore<br/>the melody in your heart while playing just because of the score.
186	It looks like people really put in their best when it comes to music...<p/>That's why I find human beings so interesting.
187	Lute? I don't know...<br/>Well, I know it's an instrument that humans use...<p/>Hey... I wasn't much help, huh...<br/>It's just that... I'm not really used to the human world yet...<p/>I wonder if I'll ever adjust to this place...
188	Lute is the name of an instrument.<br/>I heard it's one of the most common instruments, too.
189	It's an instrument that's played by plucking the strings...<br/>But it looks like people don't use it only to play music... <p/>They're crossing into my territory! I cannot forgive them!!
190	Composing skills? <br/>If I remember correctly... <br/>I heard you can make songs...<p/>Is that true? I don't want to be wrong...
191	I think being able to compose is a blessing from the gods to humans.<p/>There are some Spirits that can make songs of the Spirits...<br/>But a Spirit like me could never do such a thing.<p/><username/>, just between you and me...<br/>I'm actually tone-deaf.
192	I... have something I'd like to say...<br/>I heard some people write songs FOR people they care about...<p/>I wonder how a song like that would make me feel...<p/>It's probably an emotion only humans can feel... right?
193	Tailoring?<br/>So... you can even make clothes to wear?<p/>That can't be true.<br/>How could anyone have such power?
194	It is a pretty useful skill, as far as I know...<br/>But to make something like what I'm wearing right now...<br/>That would be too difficult, right?<p/>Spirit clothes are not actual clothes, anyway...<br/>Hey, in a sense, I made this myself.
195	I heard those with a high Tailoring skill deliver to Clothing Shops and such.<br/>I think it's really cool to be acknowledged for your skill like that.<p/>To think that people will buy and wear the clothes you've made...<p/>Heh, I'm kinda jealous of them now.
196	Magnum Shot...<br/>I'm not certain, but...<br/>I think it's a ranged skill...
197	Oh. If I'd known that's what you meant by Magnum Shot,<br/>I could've given you an answer more quickly... <p/>Now I know that it's a skill to shoot with more force,<br/>by pulling back the string as hard as possible.<br/>...Seems obvious, doesn't it?
198	Magnum Shot is a skill that's practiced by Archers.<br/>I heard it lets you shoot your arrow or bolt with more force than normal.<p/>When you're suffering from injuries in battle,<br/>I'm sure help from these Archers is desperately needed...<p/>Please don't try to fight alone...<br/>For you, and for me, who's always by your sise.
199	Counterattack? I think I might know what that is... <p/>I just don't feel so confident saying so yet...<br/>So, yeah...
200	Counterattack skill... Hmm... So this is...<br/>It's a skill that counteracts enemy attacks, right?<br/>Leaves the enemy open for a big hit.<p/>But I heard that people who use this a lot can't be trusted.<p/>Do you know what that means, by any chance?
201	The opponent sometimes provokes you to bait out a Counterattack.<br/>So when you're fighting, always keep this in mind.<p/>If you were to pretend to use a Counterattack skill,<br/>it might be a good way to confuse the opponent.
202	Smash skill?<p/>I don't know... It may or may not be the skill I'm thinking of...<br/>I'm not too confident in my answer.<p/>I'd really like to learn more before answering these questions...
203	Did you say... Smash?<p/>What do I do... should I say this or not...<br/>Oh, sorry. Don't mind me...<p/>I'll just... tell you next time.
204	Yes, if you practice the Smash skill hard, it'll really help you out.<p/>Just don't hit too hard with the weapon I'm in...<p/>It hurts...
205	Fishing skill?<br/>I don't know anything like that...<p/>Do I have to know that?<br/>Are you going to make me go fishing?
206	Oh, I know about that.<br/>It's a skill that's used for fishing.<p/>Though it does appear that some people use it not only for fishing...
207	I heard Water Spirits like to mess with fishers, and send them other items.<br/>It's partly for fun, and partly to spare the fish.<p/>I'm more interested in the objects than the fish anyway.<p/>Though the more I think about it...<br/>Those Water Spirits should be less stingy with their items.
208	Umm... about me?<br/>Hmm...<p/>Gosh, I don't remember much...<p/>I haven't even been around that long...
209	Are you really all right contracting a kid like me as your Spirit?<br/>I mean, I know so little...<p/>But, I promise to use all my might so I can be of help to you!<p/>Just, y'know... Please help me grow!<br/>I promise you I'll grow to be the best!
210	What's your favorite color, <username/>?<p/>Mine is blue. It's also the color of your mana, the sky, and...<p/>Well, it's just a super soothing color.<br/>The seas are supposed to be a deep, relaxing blue, too.<br/>I wonder what else is blue...<p/>Uh... Are my eyes blue?<br/>If that's what you want, they just might be...
211	I heard there are female Spirits.<br/>I'd love to meet them...
212	Hmm... The appearance of Spirits doesn't always match their power<p/>But then, I wonder what causes us to look like adults?<p/>I guess I just have to be around for a long, long time...<br/>Umm... Does that mean I'll be this big for a long, long time?
213	I hear that some Spirits go back to being a stone<br/>because their master doesn't take good care of them...<p/>If that's true, isn't it just the saddest thing?<br/>You wouldn't do that to me, right, <username/>?
214	What could I possibly teach you?
215	I'll try my best to be helpful to you.<p/>So, um... please help me a bunch to grow and gain knowledge!
216	It's quite the kerfuffle until you can actually see it in action,<br/>so I might not able to help you all that often.<p/>However, when that time comes...<br/>I'll show you the true power of the Spirit, <username/>!
217	Are you trying to do a quest of some sort?<br/>You should be looking for people who need your assistance, then...
218	The Town Office... Let's see, they have a lost and found,<br/>and a place to get quests to help other people, right?<p/>I'm sure people would love to have your help.<br/>I know I do.
219	Open up the scroll that the owls deliver to you<br/>to get all sorts of quests that people commission.<p/>You're not obligated to do these things for them,<br/>but if you think about how they personally chose you for the task...<br/>Well, you wouldn't want to disappoint them, right, <username/>?
220	A Part-time what?<br/>I have no clue what you're talking about...
221	Oh... I'm not the person who gives out Part-Time Jobs.<br/>I am a Spirit. Remember?
222	You ought to ask the townsfolk for something like that, you silly.<br/>Part-time jobs from a Spirit... ha!
223	Am I no fun because I don't know all that much?<br/>I'm worried that you might think less of me as a Spirit...
224	I do love to study, it's true...<br/>I can learn when you bring me a bunch of items, <username/>...<br/>Speaking of which...<br/>Why don't you go bring me some?
225	Oh, how I wish I could go to a school and take lessons with you, <username/>!<p/>I apologize for being so needy in my quest for knowledge.
226	You mean like... collecting stuff?<br/>I assume there's a lot more to it, if it has a specific name...<p/>Why don't you tell me more?
227	It refers to all the benefits you get from nature.<br/>I wish I could help out, but...<p/>Spirits are without a physical body...<br/>I'm sorry I can't help in that matter.
228	Did you know that everything affects your gathering efforts?<br/>From the people nearby to the weather in the region...<p/>And you can speed up the process by working with others.<br/>No reason not to work together, if you have the same goals.<p/>How do I know these things, you ask?<br/>It's all thanks to you, <username/>. You gave me the knowledge!
229	Huh? Teardrop of the Spirit...?<br/>Why would you need something like that?<p/>This is our special power, crystallized like a gem.<p/>Did... did you think it was an actual tear?
230	There's a separate skill for... resting?<br/>Oh, wow... How bizarre.<br/>I learned something new!
231	Sitting down is like the very foundation of resting.<br/>I hear it's good to sit down when you're healing, too.
232	What is your rank for Rest, <username/>?<br/>I've heard it's quite useful once you rank it up, costly though it may be.
233	I'm sorry... I'm completely inexperienced in that area.<br/>Some new items might help me figure it out...
234	It's a skill that attacks targets far away.<br/>I would still advise using magic over that, though.<br/>Even basic spells like Fireball or Thunder have more impact.<p/>Hmm... I wonder how hard it is to learn magic like that.<br/>I've always had magic, so I never really considered...
235	You know, I've been researching that, just in case you asked!<br/>It's a great skill for hitting things far away, but you have to<br/>make sure to finish them off before they reach you.<p/>That's why people study skills like Magnum Shot or Arrow Revolver so hard.<p/>Turns out learning Magnum Shot is pretty easy,<br/>but learning Arrow Revolver takes a whole quest!<br/>You can get started with a person called Aranwen, if you want.<br/>So... How was that? Was it helpful?
236	Playing instruments...<br/>I'm not too sure.<br/>I'm curious if it's anything like the one I know...
237	It's a skill that makes music, right?<br/>I do so love music.<p/>When you decide to play, please let me hear, <username/>!
238	I stand in amazement when I see people play music together.<br/>People call us Spirits beautiful, but...<br/>In those moments of creation, humans are much more beautiful.<p/>And among all of them, you're the best, <username/>! Ha ha.
239	What's that?
240	It's an instrument that makes beautiful sounds, right?<br/>You've got to play it for me sometime.<br/>I'd love to hear you play music, <username/>.
241	The lute is classified as a string instrument, you see.<br/>I've been told that there are other string instruments, like mandolin or ukulele.<p/>They each seem to have a different color, in addition to<br/>different ranges of tones that they produce!<br/>Perhaps you ought to keep this in mind when you're<br/>playing with a bunch of other people.
242	Music... Music for humans would be quite different than for Spirits, right?<p/>Hmm... I wonder how so...
243	You're talking about the skill that makes music, right?<br/>I heard it requires quite a bit of talent...<br/>I'm sure it'd be a piece of cake for you, <username/>!<br/>Since those who are adept in magic are highly intelligent, you know.
244	Having the ability to be able to create beautiful music<br/>with a few simple symbols is a true blessing.<p/>Start out by retracing the steps of others,<br/>and move on to eventually making your own.<br/>All things in this world are defined by consistent rules.<br/>Music is no different.
245	Clothes? What's that? You mean, these things I'm wearing right now?<p/>Hmm, this is just my appearance...<br/>I guess it must be different for humans.<br/>Why don't you tell me more about this?
246	It must be quite detailed work, huh? Making clothes...<br/>I hear that it's more efficient to cooperate with others on difficult tasks.<br/>I'd love to try on clothes you made, <username/>! Haha.
247	The finishing touches of sewing are what's truly important in making sturdy clothes, I hear.<br/>A skilled laborer can sew fast to produce sturdy clothes,<br/>as if they are making multiple layers.<p/>If you have the desire to produce fine clothes,<br/>but lack the talent as of now...<br/>Commissioning professional work might yield you better results.
248	I can't be sure...<br/>What kind of skill is that?
249	It's a skill exclusive to a bow, where you strike with a single, powerful shot.<p/>Be warned that you can sometimes miss your Magnum Shot, though.
250	I hear you can run around even while casting Magnum Shot if you're using a crossbow.<br/>I guess every skill has its appropriate weapon.
251	That skill name sounds awfully terrifying...
252	It's a skill that turns an enemy's strength against them, knocking them down.<br/>I wonder how that works...
253	If you're watching a friend cast the Counterattack skill, don't you worry?<br/>Seems like such a risky move...
254	I'm not sure what that is...
255	You just charge in and knock the enemies down, huh?<br/>I think these skills like Smash are truly terrifying...
256	The Smash skill, as powerful as it is, has quite a few flaws.<br/>I hear that you're quite easily counterattacked if the opponent sees it coming.
257	I, uh... have no idea what you're talking about.<br/>Is it like a gathering skill?
258	Is fishing fun? I heard you catch all kinds of things while fishing<br/>I'm curious what those are.
259	If I'm not mistaken, you can fish things related to dungeons a lot more frequently<br/>from the Emain Macha lake than you would anywhere else.<p/>Perhaps it's because all of the water flowing inside the dungeons is,<br/>after all, connected to the bottom of the lake?
260	I was without a physical body, but here I am before you,<br/>in the shape of a human, thanks to our bonding.<br/>It might sound a bit too serious,<br/>but I hope you cherish this relationship.<p/>There's nothing more miserable for a Spirit than trusting a human<br/>who fails to cherish the relationship...
261	The light that the Spirit puts out around your weapon<br/>represents the blessing of the Spirit.<p/>Although I may not be much help to you right now...<br/>This light ought to remind you of something that you can trust and rely on<br/>during that one destined moment that you're bound to face...<p/>So... Be sure to take care of your weapon. And me!
262	The more I learn... and the more I'm capable of doing...<br/>I somehow miss the first time we met, <username/>.<p/>I never imagined I'd think about something like this...<br/>I wonder what changed? I wonder why I miss the past?<p/>If... I mean, I emphasize that it's only hypothetical, but...<br/>If I became a human...<br/>If I could be born as a human...<br/>What would that be like?
263	We are all Spirits, but there's a fine line between Spirits like us, who inhabit a weapon,<br/>and the Spirits who appear from the will of nature.<br/>Strictly speaking, their powers are much greater than ours...<p/>Oh, dear... You look quite disappointed.<br/>If you'll allow me to continue...we're not entirely weak.<p/>When the human and the Spirit bound by the contract form a perfectly harmonious bond,<br/>the resultant power is comparable to that of nature Spirits.<p/>But don't let power be the only thing you chase.<br/>That'd be very sad...
264	I heard humans made up stories about weapons with their own will,<p/>as well as weapons that take control of humans who wield them.<br/>I believe such stories are made up out of fear...<br/>A fear combining the unknown powers and natures of Spirits.<p/>To be honest... we've affected each other a lot since we met.<br/>So maybe there's some truth to the rumors?<br/>What do you think?
265	When humans refer to nature, it often feels like they forget<br/>the fact that they are also part of nature.<p/>I wonder what urges them to separate themselves<br/>when the link is so clear?<p/>What do you think, <username/>?<br/>Do you consider yourself in unity with nature,<br/>or do you see yourself as a separate being from nature?<br/>...You know, I only seem to think of these things when I'm around you, <username/>.<p/>I'm sorry, ha ha ha...
266	You're curious about skills?<br/>Perhaps you ought to ask a human who might know more about skills than I?
267	Humans learn things from their teachers, or so I hear.<br/>In the human world, are there teachers who teach you skills?<p/>Well, then. They're the ones you should be talking to<br/>if you'd like to learn more about skills.
268	Be warned that the power of skills may diminish<br/>if you don't take good care of me!<p/>Ha... That was no threat, by any means.<br/>Just... take it as a suggestion to treat me with respect, <username/>.
269	Hmm? You want a quest from me?<p/>Sigh... What a disappointing attitude you have.<br/>If you took the responsibility of a contract with me...<br/>Doesn't that mean you should find tasks for yourself?<p/>I may inhabit your weapon, but I don't run your life.<p/>Really, now... what kind of "master" takes jobs from random people?
270	The owl that flies in with the quests... Let's see...<br/>Its name is... Petrock.<p/>That lady Nao isn't much for naming, is she?<br/>Ohh, I'm just kidding.
271	That space where Nao's owl flies around...<br/>That pure white space where Nao lives...<br/>Is it even a part of this world?<p/>Even I can't tell what that place is...<br/>And I'm a Spirit!<br/>As strange as it all is, one thing is clear...<br/>Even from there, she can extend her influence to this world.<p/>Nao... I wonder who she really is...
272	You wish to know about Part-Time Jobs.<br/>That's nice. But I'm a Spirit.
273	That's a bit tricky.<br/>Why don't you think about our contract a bit more carefully?
274	What makes you think that I'm in any position to tell you what to do, <username/>?<p/>I mean, I could give you advice, but...
275	The school, I hear, is a place where people lacking the experience or wisdom<br/>to live in this world gather to learn from more educated people.<p/>Honestly, I don't see how such a service is even necessary...
276	It seems that those who lack experience piece together their own<br/>from the stories and instructions of others.<p/>I see how the truths from one generation are passed on to the next.<p/>I suppose there is no better way for mortal humans...<p/>Humans are so... interesting. Ha.
277	I hear that one goes to a place called a school for lessons and training.<br/>I guess it's fine if you plan to teach yourself, but...<br/>In my opinion... What makes the human being truly shine is<br/>their relationship with one another.<p/>Perhaps you ought to visit a school if you wish to train.<br/>I suppose you'll find plenty of others just like yourself there, <username/>.<p/>Go. Talk, and try to understand one another.<br/>Build a relationship. How does that sound?
278	I mean... About something that I haven't absorbed or experienced myself...<br/>I really can't tell you much.
279	Gathering is a skill that allows humans to acquire things<br/>from nature, things they need for survival.<br/>It seems that you'll have an easier time acquiring things<br/>you need from nature if your Gathering skill is high.
280	To be honest, I always thought Gathering was a daunting and difficult skill.<br/>As it turns out, however, it might not be.<p/>Gathering eggs from hens,<br/>making firewood from trees,<br/>or simply getting water from a stream...<br/>These are all basic Gathering tasks.<p/>I see this as one of the issues with my manner.<br/>I get so serious over the tiniest things...
281	The Teardrop of the Spirit isn't an actual teardrop, you see.<br/>It's like a small gem... A manifestation of our power of blessing.<p/>I don't know what you plan to use it for, but... <br/>I hope you find a good use for it.
282	Rest skill... Let's see...<br/>Well, my notes on this appear to be missing.<p/>Honestly, I don't know enough about the human world yet.<br/>The concept of a Rest skill seems odd to me, so I'm not the right one to ask.
283	The Rest skill soothes the fatigue of the human body.<br/>The human body is like a container for the soul,<br/>drifting amidst all the substances that compose this world.<p/>When the body is weary... its soul loses a place to take refuge.<br/>Humans are quite different from Spirits in that they rely heavily on substances.<p/>Finding yourself the most stable posture<br/>that alleviates the tension across various parts of your body, I'd say,<br/>is the fundamental principle when it comes to resting.<p/>Not to mention how something like a campfire that<br/>gives you warmth would just make things perfect...
284	As the Rest skill's rank climbs higher, it will recover more HP and Stamina for you.<p/>That is... If you have a high rank in the Rest skill,<br/>you'll be able to stay active for a lot longer by recovering faster.<p/>Know your way around this skill, and will save you plenty of time.
285	A Ranged Attack... Hang on a bit...<p/>I don't think I have it jotted down here...<p/>It looks like I have to write it down again...<br/>I'll let you know how it goes. Sorry.
286	Indeed. The Ranged Attack allows you to attack enemies from afar.<p/>You'll learn about it quite naturally if you equip a bow.<br/>By that same token, you can't really<br/>use this skill without a bow or a crossbow.<p/>I sometimes feel for humans, and how strict the<br/>rules of substances are on you.
287	It's a common misconception that many believe attacking from afar<br/>can only be performed using the skills of the Ranged Attack...<p/>However, it's possible to attack those at a distance using magic as well.
288	Do you wish to know about the Playing Instrument skill?<br/>Hmm... Judging by my notes... I know nothing about it.<p/>In any case, feed me some things and...<br/>I'll try to find out more about it.
289	Ah, haven't you asked before about this? The Playing Instrument skill...<br/>Playing an instrument is a blessing from great nature.<br/>The sound of water in its flow... the howling wind...<br/>The chirping of the birds, as well as the cries of insects...<br/>The instrument is the very masterpiece of humans<br/>in an attempt to imitate these sounds.<p/>If you're interested in this skill, you ought to<br/>get your hands on an instrument first.
290	If you're interested in the Playing Instrument skill,<br/>I suggest you go to a town or a city and ask another human<br/> who appears to be well-versed in this subject.<p/>I'm afraid there's a limit to what a Spirit can explain...
291	Lute... Are you talking about the instrument?<br/>Hmm... I'll tell you another time...
292	A lute is a type of an instrument.<br/>One of those instruments made in an attempt to imitate the sound of nature...
293	The sound was made to resonate from a couple of strings<br/>attached to a wooden vessel, you see.<br/>I sometimes think that it couldn't be humans who first thought of objects like this.<p/>What do you think, <username/>?
294	The Composing skill? ...Oh, I have something noted here.<p/>Let's see... A skill used for writing music.<p/>Oh boy. That's all I have. I'm sorry.<br/>However... If you feed me something so I can better understand your world...<br/>I might be able to give you a more satisfying answer, <username/>!
295	You'll be able to compose songs of greater length as<br/>your Composing skill climbs up in rank.
296	Why not challenge yourself in composing if you're so interested?<p/>I mean, as long as you don't forget to talk to me between compositions...<br/>I mean... Not saying that you would do something like that, <username/>!
297	Tailoring, huh? I could tell you all about that without looking at my notes.<br/>I mean... As the name suggests, it's a skill used for making clothes.<p/>It's also entirely useless for spirits.
298	If I had to pick, I'd say the Sewing Pattern is what's most important<br/>when it comes to Tailoring. In my opinion.<br/>I mean, I'm not overstating anything when I say<br/>that the final shape of the clothes you make comes from the Sewing Pattern.
299	I mean...<br/>You should find the Sewing Pattern for the clothes I'm currently wearing... If, you know, you want to make it.<p/>I hate to tell you, but I haven't seen such<br/>a Sewing Pattern in all the decades of time I've been alive.<p/>This is something created by the power of the Spirit,<br/>forged by the very bond of ours.
300	The Magnum Shot is a skill unique to those who use the bow.
301	Simply put, it's like the Smash skill , but for Ranged Attacks.<p/>Wait, I'm not sure if that came out right...
302	I hear you can shoot an arrow with greater force by using the Magnum Shot skill.
303	The Counterattack skill?<br/>Hmm... All I know is that it's a skill exclusive to melee combat.<br/>I'll do my best to research it if you'd like to know more, <username/>.<p/>You gotta help me learn more about this world too, mm'kay?
304	The Counterattack skill turns the power of the opponent's attack against them.<br/>I could see this being useful in times of crisis.
305	You ought to use a skill like this in combat, really...<br/>I hardly see this being appropriate for other human interactions.<p/>Revenge always gets back at you with greater severity, you know.<br/>It might as well be the law of human interactions, but...<br/>It is also the law of nature.
306	The Smash skill?<br/>Hmm... All I know is that it's a skill exclusive to melee combat.<br/>I'll do my best to research it if you'd like to know more, <username/>.<p/>You gotta help me learn more about this world too, mm'kay?
307	Oh, yes! I dug a bit deeper into the subject,<br/>since you seemed interested last time, <username/>!<p/>Smash is a skill that attacks the enemy by concentrating your<br/>energy in an instant and directing that blow on a single point.
308	I think it is capable of delivering a blow much more powerful than generic attacks.<p/>Be warned, however, that when you use the Smash skill,<br/>you leave yourself vulnerable to taking even greater damage in return,<br/>should your opponent perform a counterattack.
309	I believe that's a method for catching fish.<br/>Let's see... To fish, you'd need a fishing rod, a bait tin, and...<br/>Oh, of course! Some place where you can fish.
310	Catching fish would indeed be extremely difficult, since humans<br/>were not designed to live under water.<p/>Still, the humans make tools to challenge themselves on just about anything.<br/>Among the handful of ways that you can catch fish,<br/>fishing allows you to do it most easily.
311	Hook the bait on the fishing rod and idle it on an appropriate location where fish swim by,<br/>luring the fish to bite down on the bait, and voila!<br/>You catch the fish!<p/>It seems that it's a lot easier said and heard than done.<p/>I mean, I suppose idling the rod and waiting endlessly is an option, but...<br/>If you're at all serious about catching fish, I hear that it's all about<br/>pulling at the right time. Perhaps you ought to keep that in mind?<p/>Oh, and also... I hear fish isn't the only thing that you catch from... fishing.
312	Oh, right! What are your impressions of me?<p/>I mean... Do I look handsome? Cute? Am I cool? Tell me!<p/>Getting to know all about the holder of our contract,<br/>the one who will be serving me, is priority one!<p/>By the way...<br/>Are you a male, or a female?<p/>Wah! You look so upset!<br/>Why are you so upset all of a sudden?<br/>Can't you see that I'm a Spirit?<br/>It's only natural that I ask questions like this!<br/>All right, all right! I'm sorry!<p/>Hmph... So sour...
313	Heh heh heh. I somehow knew you were really interested in me.<br/>I don't need to remind you that humans serving Spirits<br/>are obligated to check in frequently and extend friendly greetings, right?<p/>I guess you're one master who does this kinda well...
314	Hey, <username/>! Listen up.<br/>I couldn't help but notice that you sometimes forget I'm here,<br/>and go off to chatter on with other people,<br/>or just blank out on me!<p/>Did you even think for a moment about how bored I'd get?<br/>You gotta spend some time with me too!<br/>Don't leave me hanging, you know what I mean?
315	It seems that not many people can get Spirit Weapons such as myself...<br/>Is that true?
316	Anyone would kill to get a contract going with a Spirit like me,<br/>assuming they knew how awesome and powerful I am!<br/>Ain't that right?
317	I hear that there are some sassy female Spirits as well,<br/>and not just... awesome male Spirits like me, huh?<br/>Have you ever seen a female Spirit?<p/>I mean, not that they'd be half as impressive as I am.<p/>I mean, just look at me!<br/>They'd have to be, like, super hot to measure up!<br/>And really sharp, really funny... Yeah, that should cover it. Maybe.<br/>Man, I'm just too great, huh? Ha ha!
318	Skills? I don't think you're gonna learn much from me, human.<br/>I've got skills, sure, but not for a meatball like you.<p/>Go back to playing with your swords or... gloves... or... whatever it is you do!
319	I'm sure you're deeply impressed by my great actions, but...<br/>I haven't even showed you the best part yet!<p/>Ehem! Do you seek power, human?<br/>Seek and you shall... receive.<br/>I mean not now, but later... Ha ha!
320	<username/>! You've done a pretty decent job, helping me grow this much.<br/>Now! Buckle up for some fancy action that I'm about to show ya!<br/>Ready? Dun dun dun...
321	A quest? Is that some kinda food?
322	A quest, you say? Of course, I've got plenty to give you!<br/>Here's the first. Ready? Go get me something to eat!
323	You know, when those owls fly over and hand you scrolls, or gold...<br/>Where in the world do they get the strength to do that?<br/>Gold is heavy! Do they have special diets...?
324	What's that? Sounds kinda complicated...<br/>Is it like magic?<p/>If so, forget it!<br/>Hey! Why are you laughing?
325	Is this really the time to be asking about Part-Time Jobs?<br/>Working hard to feed me more fine items should be your focus!
326	Don't you feel kind of ripped off when you do Part-Time Jobs at the Grocery Store?<br/>You risk your life picking fruits for that shop, get paid for it, and...<br/>You use that money to buy food from that place again.<p/>Sigh. Some days I really don't get you weirdos.
327	Why are you asking me that?<br/>I'm a Spirit. You should be serving me.<br/>I'm not your teacher.
328	So... I hear humans learn a bunch of things at this place called... a school, huh?<br/>And you have to go there every single day...<p/>See, if you've got some style like me...<br/>All you'd need to do is feed on some items,<br/>and gain all the knowledge you want!<p/>You humans need to get it together.
329	Studying a lot ought to get you far, human.<br/>If you don't feel strong enough at the moment, train hard<br/>to get some cool abilities like me.<br/>I'm not saying you could ever exceed the limits of puny humanity, though.
330	What's that got to do with me?<br/>Why are you even asking me?
331	Gathering... That's like, basic human instinct, isn't it?<br/>How does anyone survive without gathering things to eat, huh?<p/>Use your brain. I shouldn't have to explain this!<br/>You like to be spoon-fed too much, human!
332	Whoa! Tell me honestly, <username/>.<br/>There were times when you wished that you could pluck arrows off the ground,<br/>like picking flowers, instead of having to buy or make them yourself, huh?<p/>Ha! I see right through you.<br/>Poor, materialistic humans.
333	What now? A teardrop?<br/>You think I shed tears from this totally godlike body?<br/>Geez, you don't get me at all!<p/>...Ha ha ha, I'm just joking!<br/>You should have seen the look on your face!<br/>Ahh... It's just a gem for us Spirits.<br/>I guess it got its weird name from how it looks.
334	A Resting skill?<br/>Are you trying to pull some sick yoga moves or something?
335	I'll put it this way.<br/>A proper rest requires proper scope and efficiency.<br/>That's why there's a separate skill for it. If that makes sense...
336	Sitting down won't simply recover your stamina or wounds, you see.<br/>If you're stuck like that, don't be stubborn and ask for help, okay?<p/>Still, I hear that some humans suddenly transform into a<br/>glimmering white knight or something on rare occasions.<br/>Then, they're not hungry anymore, and all of their<br/>wounds instantly recover or something!<br/>Sounds crazy, right?
337	Ranged Attack is the most basic form of attack when you're using a bow!<br/>Are you telling me you don't know what that is?
338	Ha, so you want to know about Ranged Attacks from me, huh?<p/>Ranged Attacks hit opponents from afar. It's one of the safest,<br/>most efficient ways to attack. I'm telling ya, it's as good as combat gets!<p/>Those who've mastered Ranged Attacks have already won the fight before it even begins. Ha ha!
339	As basic as it may be in terms of attacking enemies from a distance,<br/>did you know that Ranged Attacks have a lot of variance when<br/>they develop through further mastery?<br/>One prime example is the Magnum Shot, which is a skill<br/>that delivers a fatal blow...<br/>Wait, you knew that already?<p/>Well... There's also a more advanced skill called the Arrow Revolver...<br/>I'm telling you! If you learn this skill, you'll dominate the battlefield!
340	Playing instruments?<br/>Why would you ask me about that?
341	Ultimately, the Playing Instrument skill is about using the force of wind.<br/>And that's my domain, as a Spirit resembling the mighty winds!<br/>Now do you understand the scope of my powers? Ah ha ha!
342	An excellent musician can tell the condition of an instrument simply<br/>by listening to the sound of the strings.<p/>The sweet sound tells so much!<br/>Don't underestimate music, human.
343	A lute... Isn't that an instrument?<br/>What about it?
344	Do you know why a string instrument is called a string instrument?<br/>That's because strings are attached to them, just like<br/>how there is a bowstring attached to the bow.<br/>That's why some bards take up the lute to replace the bow!<p/>...I'm kidding. Did you actually believe that? Ha ha ha!
345	I sometimes see people swinging their lute around while playing.<br/>Do they think it's some kind of toy? Or worse, a weapon?<br/>People are animals, I swear...
346	Composing? What's that? If it's cool and powerful, teach me!<br/>You already know how to do that, right?<p/>Feed me some smart items, human!
347	I hear good music comes from good composing...<br/>But how are the two related?<br/>I've seen one person compose, and a different person<br/>make the music score for that composition.<p/>I swear, you humans have to make everything so complicated!
348	I mean, what's there to discuss about fine arts, when you're<br/>the living embodiment of art, itself... I'm talking about me.<br/>Still, those who are talented in composing are genuinely... artistic.<p/>To me, they're just drawing little bean-sprout-looking things all over the place...<br/>Yet that somehow turns into fine music!<br/>I can't be the only one amazed by that, right?
349	Ask a human about something like that, not me!<br/>Spirits don't have time for such petty things.
350	Making clothes?<br/>Oh, you mean that! Yeah! You just get some things<br/>and do some loops or whatever, you know what I mean?<p/>Just look at my wild, magnificent look.<br/>How could a human ever catch up to this, you know?<br/>I mean, you gotta be as hot as I am to talk about style!
351	So... If you're really good at it, you could, in theory, make clothes that are<br/>even tougher than any ordinary armor, huh?<p/>Look, if you were good enough to claim a Spirit Weapon like me,<br/>you must be better than any of those ordinary humans out there!<br/>Why don't you try making those clothes of your own?<br/>I heard there's nothing difficult about it. Go on, try it!
352	Uh, isn't that a skill any bow wielder is gonna need?
353	Magnum Shot! Talk about art, human!<p/>Have you ever heard the phrase, one shot, one kill?<br/>Well, Magnum Shot is exactly that!
354	That feeling when you pull the bowstring to the point of breaking,<br/>and release all that tension in a single shot! Nothing compares to that!<p/>Don't be fooled, though. You can still miss a shot like that from time to time.<br/>I hear using handmade arrows improves your accuracy.<br/>Perhaps you ought to make some?
355	Why are you asking me such a thing?<br/>You're just testing to see if I know it or not, aren't you?<br/>You're a mess.
356	It's a skill that parries the opponent's attack and uses their<br/>own strength against them to deliver a counterattack...<br/>You know, I don't think you need to get excited about that.
357	I guess, if you're using ranged attacks but your target breaks through...<br/>You can Counterattack to regain the advantage. Maybe.
358	What kind of skill is that?<br/>Boy, you better not be messing with me...
359	Simply because you can knock an opponent down in a single blow,<br/>it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good skill.<br/>If you just charge forward like an idiot,<br/>you're going to get surrounded and destroyed.<br/>Think this stuff through!
360	Having to approach your enemies to attack them<br/>opens you up to a lot of danger.<br/>Higher damage isn't always the way.
361	Fishing... Hmm, that sounds familiar.
362	There's nothing wrong with fishing, it's just...<br/>It was intended to catch... fish, right?<p/>So what are all these weird things that get fished up...
363	The way I see it, the fish aren't the primary focus of fishing.<br/>It's all about fishing... Great! Fortune!
364	Ta-da! How do you like my style?<br/>Geez, paying no interest in a lady like myself...<br/>Is that not rude among your kind?<p/>So, then... What's up with you?<br/>Ha ha...
365	What do your friends think about you?<br/>Oh, I mean...<br/>I heard a story from the human world, you see.<br/>If you want to know more about someone, then observe<br/>what kind of friends they hang out with...<p/>After observing for a bit, however,<br/>you don't introduce me to others, and...<br/>Well, I'm not even sure what kind of people you hang out with...<p/>I mean, all you do is talk to your weapons.<br/>I suppose it's only natural that you don't have any friends...<p/>Oh, that was only a joke. Relax!<br/>You're not the type who gets upset over something like this, are you?<br/>Then you really wouldn't have any friends...
366	Come to think of it... It's been quite a while since we first met.<br/>Mull over our past memories, and tell me how you feel.<br/>For me... I think I've gotten to know humans a bit better.<p/>Always seeking sweetness, avoiding what's sour...<br/>Happy when receiving, resentful when being asked to give...<p/>Oh my, the look on your face!<br/>Feeling guilty about something?
367	Human society is pretty shallow, isn't it?<p/>I mean, that suits me just fine, but really!<br/>People put entirely too much stock in appearances.<br/>Just being attractive shouldn't be a free pass for anything.<br/>It's not even something you really control!
368	Humans are truly odd.<br/>They tend to be so self-serving, but at the same time...<br/>There's such concern for everything around them!<p/>Is it out of a sincere worry for others?<br/>Or do they worry about how those matters will reflect on them?<p/>It's such a curious question for me...<br/>Honestly, I find humanity so utterly fascinating.<p/>Perhaps it's because... I've seen self-sacrifice as well.<br/>It doesn't fit with everything else I've seen, but...<br/>Somehow it still happens.<p/>I wonder if I'll ever truly understand...
369	Come to think of it, I've seen humans traveling with pets.<br/>More often than not, I've been given the impression that there<br/>are a lot of animals that are hostile towards humans,<br/>but I guess they can still find a few that don't want to kill them.<p/>I recall it was quite difficult to talk to those animals<br/>who were hostile towards humans...<br/>I once heard that it's because the Fomor Scroll<br/>seizes control of their will, overriding their feelings...<br/>Ha... Oh, <username/>... That look...<p/>There are some things you are so very passionate about...<br/>And other topics like this where you seem so distant.<br/>Try investing in the interests of others, hmmm?
370	You want to know about skills?<p/>Ha ha. I'll consider teaching you if you bring me something good. La la la lala...
371	Ha! Well, aren't you straightforward...<br/>Very well. Skills are essentially what you are capable of.<p/>I once heard in passing that skills for warriors are the equivalent<br/>of appearance for socialites in human culture.<br/>I guess it all requires a lot of effort, as well as money and time, to perfect.
372	Speaking of skills...<br/>I hear people use Spirits to get around some of their skill shortcomings.<p/>I can't imagine you're someone like that, <username/>... are you?
373	My oh my... You should try to figure out something like that on your own<br/>without having to rely on a poor woman like me...<p/>Not. Nice. At all!<br/>Actually, I don't even know what we're talking about. Ha ha!
374	I agree that pets are the big thing these days.<br/>If you're an elegant and a luxurious type,<br/>they seem like they'd be the perfect accessory.<p/>An owl that delivers scrolls, on the other hand...<br/>This lady called Nao...<br/>She's on a whole other level.
375	I believe all the other owls reside at the Town Office.<br/>However, I believe it's those owls that miss Nao raises<br/>who are different from all the other owls...<p/>White owls that fly in a great white void, huh?<p/>You know, I'm thinking about raising a pet myself.<br/>What do you think?<p/>I wonder what kind of animal I'd get along with best...
376	A part what? What's that?<br/>Sounds boring.
377	A Part-Time Job?<br/>Hmm... I guess your work ethic is admirable... for some...<br/>But honestly, doesn't this just mean your career is in trouble?<p/>If you're having this much trouble staying afloat,<br/>perhaps we ought to reconsider our contract?
378	Part-Time Jobs don't seem all that profitable for you, considering your status, <username/>.<p/>Perhaps you should consider doing other things for money...
379	If it were up to me, I wouldn't recommend relying too heavily on schools.<p/>Hmm. Perhaps we can find a different time to talk about the details?
380	The relationship between those who learn and those who teach...<br/>The competition and jealousy between those who learn...<br/>Not to mention the unseen discord between the educated and uneducated...<p/>When I observe such things... I am reminded that humans are complex creatures.<br/>Spirits subsist off of knowledge, but you...<p/>Again, it's one of those things I cannot fully understand. Ha...
381	Lessons and training... Is this how you tell me that you're interested in<br/>learning how you can take a better care of me?<p/>Ha ha ha, how thoughtful!<br/>I'm afraid that's outside the areas of my expertise, however.<p/>Perhaps you should figure it out yourself?
382	The Gathering skill?<br/>Oh, I see. Humans need to, by design,<br/>acquire everything they need from the nature, right?<br/>Gosh, I almost forgot... Ha...<p/>Now is not a very good time for this talk, however.<br/>I'll tell you later after... asking around here and there. Like... Later, later.
383	I guess it's all thanks to the Gathering skill after all,<br/>that we've come to meet like this, you and I. Heh... p/>If I were capable of drinking those alcohols humans drink,<br/>I'd even propose a toast for your Gathering skill!
384	Being able to use the Gathering skill well is realizing the fact<br/>that humans can co-exist harmoniously with the nature...<p/>As well as figuring out how one would resort to<br/>using such a power capable of changing nature itself.<p/>To be honest... Those are some of the considerations of<br/>human nature that I find interesting. Ha ha...
385	Ah... There's no one more pathetic than those who cause others to shed tears...<p/>Still, <username/>...<br/>I might consider giving you some if it's for a good cause.<p/>I mean, this is merely a manifestation of our blessings... not an actual teardrop.
386	You want to know about the Rest skill?<p/>Ha. I'll think about telling you if you give me something. La lala...
387	Just as how a human needs the Rest skill,<br/>Spirit Weapons like me need to be constantly fed.<br/>That's like resting for me!
388	I hear that humans are in no way like the Spirits,<br/>in that they cannot stay active without resting for long periods.<br/>Is that true? <p/>...It must be quite inconvenient, living as a human. Ha ha...
389	...You're not actually thinking that I wouldn't know such a thing, right?<br/>That'd be... disappointing.
390	Please don't forget that you need an arrow or a bolt for performing<br/>Ranged Attacks with weapons such as the bow...
391	The more adept you are in this skill, the greater damage you'll be able<br/>to inflict on an opponent using a bow or a crossbow. <p/>...There. I said it. Heh!
392	Come to think of it, I never imagined myself having such a scholarly conversation with a human...<p/>It's just you, right?<br/>I'm sure others wouldn't be like this.<p/>Oh, that satisfied look on your face...<br/>So easily swayed by such a small compliment...
393	Didn't you already ask about the Playing Instrument skill before?<br/>There are too many things about the human world that I must learn...<br/>Even a Spirit like me, equipped with intelligence and beauty, forgets things.<p/>Oh, but don't be disappointed. Continue to cherish me!
394	There's not a thing that I find more joyful than listening to you playing instruments.<p/>It's the most tangible reassurance I have of your love.
395	Hmm? What are you talking about?<p/>A... Lute...?<br/>Oh, you're talking about an instrument played by humans? <p/>I don't know much about those yet, but...<br/>Who knows? I might be able to tell you later... Ha ha ha...
396	I've heard that, among the Bards of the past, there were some<br/>who used their Lutes to shoot arrows.<br/>That's right. They used the Lute as a ranged weapon.<p/>However, in the present... I see more people using it like a club.<br/>Using a Lute like a blunt weapon...<br/>Why does it feel like time is flowing backward. I mean, come on.
397	The Lute is one of the most popular instruments, as it's easy to handle and plain.<p/>I believe some use it as a weapon, too, but...<br/>Using a Lute as a weapon would be nonsense, like<br/>using a Spirit Weapon like me as an instrument.<p/>I could see such an act being acceptable in dire situations, but...<br/>It'd be a problem if you misunderstand its original purpose,<br/>or simply do it for fun... Right?
398	How would you like it if you had the Composing skill?<p/>Hmm... I suppose it could make one moody, focusing so much on creation.<p/>I would say, however, that it wouldn't be wise to learn Composing or music in general<br/>unless you're prepared to bare your soul to the world.<p/>Oh, I could go on and on, but...
399	Yes, the music from the worlds of humans and Spirits is different, but...<br/>Recently, after listening to the music composed by humans,<br/>I've wanted to share something with all the humans out there.<p/>Yes... Most humans seem to use music to enrich themselves,<br/>or their standing in society.<p/>I suppose I can see the value in that, but even so...<br/>Music should be an expression of truth...<br/>A truth regarding one's own existence, not something shallow.<p/>That's the proper respect that music deserves, in my opinion.
400	The Composing skill, paired with the Playing Instrument skill,<br/>is the most important aspect in the world of music.<br/>I mean, this is where the songs humans sing originate from, am I right?<p/>The songs humans sing may be different than those sung by the Spirits,<br/>but they still tickle our ears from time to time, flying adrift<br/>in the flow of all nature. I like that.<p/>How the humans accept nature, and what kind of music<br/>they play in that acceptance, is very interesting to us. <p/>However, I find that many humans often underestimate music.<br/>I think that's like saying they've never felt the true power of music,<br/>being able to deliver something that can't be expressed otherwise.<p/>What is the melody swirling inside you, I wonder?<br/>Won't you let it out for me?
401	The Tailoring skill?<br/>Ha ha... You want to make me a pair of clothes, or something?<p/>I have a thing for pretty clothes, but...<br/>I'll take anything you give me, <username/>, if you make it for me yourself. Ha ha...
402	The Tailoring skill requires things like a Tailoring Kit, fabrics, and sewing patterns.<p/>It requires a lot of preparation and tedious labor, but...<br/>Being able to wear something you made yourself must bring such satisfaction.<p/>Or so I hear. I've never experienced such a thing. Ha ha.
403	Oh, I also heard a saying... Clothes put wings on your back, I think it was?<br/>I mean, some really do try to prove the importance of Tailoring, huh?<p/>Still, it's all very unconvincing to the Spirits.<br/>My wings aren't attached to no clothes!
404	Magnum Shot? Oh, my! You still don't know what that is?<p/>Sigh... What a pain you are sometimes...
405	The Magnum Shot is much like the Smash skill for melee combat.<br/>You know, the fundamentals and the damage... It's all so very similar!<p/>However, the main difference is that you're safe from Counterattack.
406	The Magnum Shot is a skill that anyone using a bow or a crossbow should know.<p/>This skill pulls the string to its limit, then looses a devastating shot.
407	The Counterattack skill?<br/>Hmm... It sounds fun, but I'm not familiar with it.<p/>Who knows? If you shower me with gifts,<br/>I might suddenly pick up interest in it...
408	What use would a skill like that have?<br/>I'm not so sure.
409	The Counterattack skill...<p/>I have to be honest, it sounds like a cowardly move.
410	The Smash skill?<br/>I'm... not sure what that is?
411	As charming as delivering a fatal blow is, it's prone to leaving you just as open.<br/>I think there are plenty of other fine skills these days.
412	To be honest, I'm a big fan of attacking a large area, instead of a single target.<br/>Quicker to take care of all at once, you know? Ha!
413	I hear that, to certain fishing aficionados, catching fish as well as other items<br/>isn't all there is when it comes to fishing.<p/>At first, I thought it was nothing but an excuse for<br/>catching and eating poor, defenseless creatures...<p/>However, in my recent observations of people fishing,<br/>I have come to realize that there might indeed be something greater to it.<p/>What does it feel like to go fishing in perfect weather,<br/>on a lake or a reservoir touched by a cool breeze?<p/>I'd like to experience that, if only once.
414	Speaking of fishing... Have you ever been asked out on a date before?<br/>You know, when someone lays out bait in the form of flirting.<p/>Ha ha! Perhaps something like that would only occur in your dreams, <username/>...<br/>Oh, but it did remind me of something to tell you.<br/>If one without a profound knowledge of relationships suddenly<br/>developed feelings suitable for a romantic relationship,<br/>they ought to be careful of such strange feelings,<br/>no matter how charming that someone seems.<p/>To be honest, that sensation of being baited in feelings<br/>isn't all that bad...<p/>You lose the opportunity to truly get to know someone,<br/>and simply chase after your feelings blindfolded, to no avail.<p/>Heh. Who else would tell you something like this<br/>in such a detailed manner? Only me, <username/>. Only me.
415	You know... I hear the term "fishing" doesn't always refer to catching fish.<br/>It can be used for describing relationships between humans, too.<br/>I once heard a story about it from a... sketchy figure, to be sure.<br/>They spoke coarsely about their pursuit... so distasteful.<p/>I couldn't simply laugh it off as meaningless, because...<br/>The romantic relationship between two people is based on deception.<br/>You know, pushing and pulling at each other at the right moments?<br/>Most people seem to agree with the whole idea, too. <p/>Ha, what do you think?<br/>Do you have anybody in mind who you'd like to... fish for?<br/>Or anybody in particular who you'd like to be fished up by?<p/>How about me? Ha ha ha!
416	As you already know, my name is <newegoname/>.<p/>I've been asleep inside that fossil for a such a long time...<br/>You could not comprehend the length of time.<p/>There were periods when I couldn't tell if I was awake or not.
417	Don't you think it's inefficient to have to feed to acquire knowledge?<p/>Why must Spirits feed on items?<p/>Humans have the freedom to choose a wide variety of methods<br/>when it comes to training and improving their abilities.<p/>How is it that Spirits are so limited?
418	I recently found out that humans forbid<br/>the practice of human transmutation amongst themselves.<br/>Human transmutation would benefit the sick and impaired, though.<p/>These human rules... make no sense sometimes.
419	Rumors between humans...<br/>Wouldn't you know more about such a thing than I do?<p/>I don't really interact with others, so...<br/>I don't have much knowledge of it yet.
420	I hear that a certain boy transforms into a bear at a specific hour.<p/>Isn't that interesting?<p/>I think one can use the powers of Alchemy to transform like that.<p/>Hm... Who shall I use as a guinea pig...?
421	I understand that the Druids and Alchemists have quarreled for ages.<p/>The main point of contention seems to be differences in their politics.<p/>I wonder if that's really all there's to it?
422	You're already equipped with an abundance of abilities,<br/>and there's nothing for me to really teach you.
423	Since the effects of my skill will vary according to my abilities...<br/>You must continue to bring me items to feed on.<p/>Just as you've been doing thus far... You must do so forever.
424	Do you want to know a secret skill that only spirits know?<p/>You do? Ha ha!<p/>I was just kidding.<br/>We... don't actually have any secret skills.<p/>I mean, I can't even emerge from my weapon if you don't call me.
425	No matter how capable owls are, they can't enter dungeons<br/>if they don't have hands... They have to open doors, and dig underground...<p/>If you're waiting to receive something, you had best wait outside.
426	Hmm, quests...<br/>Sure, I've just thought of one for you.<p/>Bring me an item to feed on. Easy-peasy, right?
427	I've come to a realization that each Milletian has 2 owls who are exclusively in charge.<br/>That means... There are twice as many owls than there are Milletians in this world.<br/>You don't, however, see owls like you do some street pigeons, do you now?<p/>If you ask me... I believe they transmute disposable single-use owls,<br/>and get rid of them after the job gets done.<br/>Oh, wait... You could just have a single pigeon fly multiple times, then...<br/>Ugh, I should just stop thinking about these things.
428	Anyone can take Part-Time Jobs to help villagers with their random errands.
429	However, you have to apply at the right time.<br/>Apparently, villagers are SO picky about their help, they refuse<br/>to accept any if it's not at a time they like.
430	Certain Part-Time Jobs give you special rewards that aren't given anywhere else.<p/>The Church Part-Time Job gives Holy Water of Lymilark, for example.<p/>You can't make or purchase that.<p/>They've got quite a racket going...
431	The School in Tir Chonaill is famous for its support of newcomers.<p/>The Dunbarton School is also good, but focuses on more advanced lessons.<br/>I say, if you can skip the easy stuff, do it.
432	Speaking of education... When alchemy was first developed, everything was new<br/>Many accidents and tragedies occurred in the name of progress.<p/>Things exploding or freezing during an item combination was nothing unusual, and some unlucky alchemists were even transformed.<br/>Of course, without their sacrifices, we wouldn't have the powers we enjoy today. Respect your history!
433	Training can be done anywhere, and you can take lessons at Schools.<br/>However, isn't actual battle the best training for battle?<br/>As long as you are cautious and pick your battles,<br/>I say that's the smartest way to train.
434	Do you really want to talk about that? I can't fathom why...
435	In some ways, it's a survival instinct.<p/>People gather food to eat, make clothes<br/>by gathering wool to protect themselves...<p/>Thinking about it like this, humans live quite true to their instincts.
436	Come to think of it, alchemy itself is the skill developed to make supernatural<br/>objects or precious metals from everyday materials.<br/>It'd be so much easier if one could simply create gold or silver ores using alchemy,<br/>without having to mine such ores yourself.<p/>Why should alchemists be prohibited from making precious ores?
437	You wish to see me cry?<br/>You'r weird, <username/>...<p/>Why would you want to see me cry?<br/>What's your true motivation for this?<p/>Do you even know what the Teardrops of the Spirit are for?<br/>They are my blessings, crystallized into physical form.
438	I like resting. Who doesn't?<br/>Sometimes, I just want to forget it all and relax all day...
439	I'm the most relaxed when I get to go somewhere quiet.<br/>I can just sit back and revel in the sating of my intellectual appetite,<br/>absorbing item after item, just watching time go by.<p/>I feel so much better when I get to gain knowledge on my terms.<br/>Don't you think learning is fun?
440	Mortals tend to think we Spirits can go and go without rest.<br/>That's just plan rude!<p/>We need sustenance and rest!<br/>In fact, we need a lot more than you people.<p/>You'll understand if I'm not always ready to jump out at your call.
441	Hmm, I guess they could be related...<p/>Is this something I should know?
442	Ranged attacks are a lot safer than melee attacks. They keep you at a safe distance.
443	It doesn't matter if you use ranged, melee, or summon attacks.<br/>The most important thing is to keep yourself alive.<p/>How you fight isn't really important!<p/>Do you really think you'll have time to strategize your attacks<br/>when a blade is flying at your face?<br/>You have to catch your enemies off-guard if you want to win!
444	I don't know why, but I get angry when I hear that.<p/>Why do you suppose that is?
445	People use instruments to play music.<br/>I often hear it described as beautiful, but it's really just noise.<p/>If it means something to someone, great, but I just don't get it.<br/>Don't worry... I spend my time appreciating more important things.
446	You can't have a jam session with yourself, you know.<p/>I'd like to see you try, though!<br/>Ha, I can imagine you trying to play an instrument in each hand, and one with your feet!<p/>Maybe you could try playing one with your mouth, too! Ha ha ha!
447	Isn't that an instrument?
448	It's a magical combination of wood and strings.<p/>It produces sad, happy, or romantic sounds,<br/>depending on the person playing.<br/>It would be a lot easier to just TELL people how you feel, though.<p/>Like I do!
449	Did you know that lutes are one of the oldest string instruments?<br/>It looks like a mandolin, but they're two very different instruments.<p/>Or that's what people tell me, anyway.<br/>I have no use for music, so...<br/>It's all food to me.
450	Just bring me something to eat, already!<br/>Why are you being such a slowpoke?<br/>Don't ask questions I can't answer!
451	Composing is how music gets transcribed to paper.<br/>Making Music Scores allows artists to preserve and share their songs.<p/>It takes a long time, too...<br/>I'm sure there's something more important people could do with their time.<p/>For example, you could get me more items to feast on!
452	It's easy to transcribe a Music Score even if you don't know much about music.<br/>Of course, you need to study a bit before you can write chords.<p/>The real musical geniuses, though, they just play from the heart.<br/>I've heard that the best musicians craft their music free-form as they perform.<p/>If you ask me...<br/>It's a remarkable talent, wasted on making music.<br/>If only I could do that with alchemical formulae...<br/>Don't you agree?
453	What is this skill now?<br/>And why should I care?
454	It's a skill used to make clothes.<p/>I guess lots of people want clothes made just for them.<br/>Tailoring seems like a waste of effort, but I understand the desire to be unique.<p/>My uniqueness is why you like me so much, right?
455	The purpose of clothes has changed over time.<p/>People once wore clothes to protect themselves from harsh weather,<br/>but nowadays people wear clothes as a fashion statement.<p/>Well, I don't need special clothes<br/>to make a statement about myself!<p/>My personality speaks volumes, doesn't it?
456	That doesn't sound useful OR interesting.<br/>What's the point?
457	It's a special archer skill that shoots an extra-powerful arrow.
458	The Magnum Shot is a skill that is commonly used by archers.<br/>It is very strong, but has a chance of missing the target.
459	Is that where you attack the bartender? Over the counter?
460	You could use transmutation on yourself, and have your doppelganger try Counterattack, no?<p/>You've got nothing to lose this way.<br/>You have to admit, it's a pretty great plan, huh?<br/>Right, let's give it a try. It'll make for a great experiment...
461	You might run into enemies immune to ranged attacks at times.<p/>For these enemies, Counterattack might actually come in handy,<br/>since they will likely run towards you like fools.<p/>Just be careful not to miss your Counterattack.
462	Smash sounds pretty strong.<br/>Is that a drink?
463	I was wondering... Would it be possible to...<br/>Combine an area of effect attack and Smash?<p/>Just imagine Smash wreaking havoc over a large area!
464	You ask about these ridiculous skills, but don't even consider their value.<br/>Fine, fine. I'll do my part in educating you.<p/>Imagine there is a group of enemies charging at you.<p/>You think, "Gee, Smash would be GREAT for thinning these guys out!"<p/>SO, you set up your Smash, and take out one foe in a single strike.<br/>Good job! And now you have the rest of his friends crowded around you,<br/>beating the daylights out of you.<p/>Smash is only good against a single target, and makes you more vulnerable to groups, <username/>.
465	Is that one of those Gathering skills?
466	Fish can be eaten by mortals for food. I guess other fish eat them too.<p/>You can get bigger fish with smaller fish!
467	I heard some people actually enjoy sitting around all day,<br/>trying to catch fish out of a lake.<p/>Some people even like the sitting part more than the catching part!<br/>What's so fun about waiting around?<p/>These people even go so far as to release the fish when they catch them.<br/>They just catch and release and catch and release...<br/>I suppose playing with living organisms for entertainment<br/>isn't such a bad way to spend your time. Is that what you think?
468	When our contract began, it felt like a waking dream.<br/>The newness of my vessel and my surroundings were so disorienting.<p/>When spirits become stone, all of their previous memories disappear.<br/>I shall have to make a fresh start with you.
469	We take our appearance partly from your imagination.<br/>Is this what you expected me to look like, <username/>?
470	As far as I know, the Alchemy skill can summon a minion called a Golem.<p/>If you come to summon the strongest Golem,<br/>you'll apparently be able to plow through battles easily.<br/>Moreover, there's the Frozen Blast, which you can use to freeze and seal the opponent.<br/>If you utilize this skill well, you may be able to defeat<br/>your enemies without taking any damage.<p/><username/>, which skill do you mainly attack with?
471	Gossip and rumors hold no interest for me.<br/>So much baseless, meaningless information...<p/>It's exhausting to keep up with, and serves no purpose.
472	I've heard of something called an Alchemy Crystal Bag that you might be interested in.<br/>It's for alchemists who work with many crystals at once.<p/>You can get them from alchemists in Taillteann and Tara,<br/>so look into them if you're having trouble keeping your crystals organized.
473	Berched, the Druid in Taillteann, has been making trouble at the Taillteann Bank.<p/>It's driving the young banker there crazy. Poor Devi.
474	You seem to know most techniques already, don't you?<br/>I don't think there is anything interesting that I can teach you.
475	I think we are finally ready. <br/>Of course, if you want the full effect, I still have more growing to do.<br/>I hope you don't mind helping me a little more.
476	You should focus on mastering the skills you have.<br/>That will make you stronger than cluttering your mind with more ideas.
477	Quests? Really?<p/>I am contracted to you.<br/>I cannot give you orders, and I wouldn't want to.
478	We should cooperate.<p/>Besides, if I need something, I'll just ask.
479	I don't know how all of the owls are trained, because there's<br/>definitely more than a few of them.<br/>The work is pretty incredible, but I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.
480	Are you thinking of getting a Part-Time Job?<p/>That's a wonderful idea. I was starting to think you might be allergic to work.<p/>That wasn't a joke.
481	Many people take Part-Time Jobs to get the unique rewards they offer.<p/>Noteworthy ones include Holy Water of Lymilark from the Church<br/>and the Seeds from the Tir Chonaill Grocery Store.
482	You enjoy farming, don't you, <username/>?<br/>If so, I recommend doing the Restaurant Part-Time Job in Tir Chonaill.<br/>Your reward will be a Seed that you can plant at your Homestead..<br/>The types of Seeds you get are completely random,<br/>but it's the best Part-Time Job for collecting them.
483	Schools in Tir Chonaill and Dunbarton are always open,<br/>so you can go there anytime you want training.<br/>They're a valuable service, so make use of them.
484	You can learn quite a bit at school, but it's not mandatory for you to go.<p/>It comes down to whether you consider basics and methods more important<br/>than real-world experience. It's a tough call, I admit.
485	Studying is certainly important, but it is hard to beat real-world experience.<p/>There's a saying that actions speak louder than words.<br/>I completely agree with that statement.<br/>Think about it. No matter how many times you study how to Smash,<br/>you won't really know if you can do it until you try it in battle.
486	Gathering is an excellent pursuit. You should gather more things for me to absorb, in fact.<br/>I know what the word "gathering" means.<br/>If you had something more specific in mind, you'll have to explain.
487	If you think about it, Gathering is one way people really express themselves.<br/>Those who care about fashion and self-expression gather Wool and Cobwebs for Tailoring.<br/>If they want strong weapons and armors, they'll mine ore and focus on Metallurgy.<p/>And you, <username/>, gather items for me to absorb. Right?
488	Even in something as simple as Gathering, there are ways to specialize.<br/>All gatherers must choose from Herbalism, Metallurgy, and Fishing.<br/>No matter what you choose, though, you should train your Production Mastery.<p/>That way, your work in Gathering and producing items from your work<br/>will be more efficient, and reward you better.<p/>Don't bother doing something if you won't do it well.
489	The Teardrop of the Spirit is the crystallized form of a spirit's blessings.
490	Are you getting enough rest?<br/>I don't want to see you tired and stressed out.<br/>Especially if it's your own fault.
491	There are various ways to rest.<p/>The most common are sleeping, meditating, exercising, eating, and getting a massage.<p/>Which one are you most interested in, <username/>?
492	Without food or rest,you really just shut down.<p/>Take care of yourself, <username/>,<br/>and make sure you're always in good health.
493	Wait, so it's a weapon called "Range" that's long...<p/>No, that can't be right. Forget I said that.
494	Melee attacks are performed at close range using<br/>Blunt Weapons, Swords, Wooden Blades, Fishing Poles, or other such weapons.<p/>Long-range attacks are performed from a distance, like with Bows.
495	The advantage of long-range attacks is engaging enemies from a safe distance.<br/>They are ideal for battles in open areas.<p/>While in tight, narrow spaces though, it's a different story.<br/>That's why you should always have a plan for when enemies draw near.
496	You're quite knowledgeable, <username/>.<br/>I need to study if I'm going to have good conversations with you.<p/>On that note, I'm hungry. Do you have anything I can absorb?
497	Anyone with an instrument can use the Playing Instrument skill.<br/>At first, you just learn harmony and practice, but over time,<br/>you can learn to play even the hardest songs.<br/>I'd love to hear you play, <username/>.<br/>Especially a song with special effects...
498	Have you ever heard an Enthralling Performance?<br/>When done correctly, it entrances all nearby Fomors and animals.<p/>Even terrible beasts will follow you like loyal pets.
499	I know it's an instrument, but...<br/>How are you supposed to play it?
500	This is the most basic instrument for performing.<p/>It looks like a Mandolin, but I assure you, it's quite different.<br/>Look here, the size, shape, and number of strings are all different...
501	Lutes are nice, but a true performer should learn to branch out.<br/>Mandolins, Ukuleles, Drums, and Flutes all have their own merits.<p/>I wonder which one would boost my knowledge the most...
502	Composing? Composing what?<br/>I need more items to absorb to make sense of this.
503	The difference between playing an Instrument and Composing is like night and day.<p/>Anyone can play an Instrument, given enough practice,<br/>but Composing requires a great deal of time, study, and focus.<p/>I have nothing but the utmost respect for artists that<br/>both create and play their own music.
504	You need a high level of Musical Knowledge to compose better Scores.<p/>It's not necessary for simple music, but anything grand requires some work.<p/>Only a select few have what it takes to make great songs, <username/>.<br/>I wonder, could you be one of them?<br/>I would be so very impressed...
505	There really is no end to the skills a person can learn, huh?<br/>So, what's this one all about?
506	Tailoring is not a task to be taken lightly. It requires immense dedication.<br/>You need a Tailoring Kit, a Sewing Pattern, Fabric, Leather,<br/>and whatever else the pattern requires.<p/>Are you willing to make that kind of commitment to making clothes?<br/>This is another element of culture I simply do not follow.<br/>Why do people go to such lengths to clothe themselves?<br/>Why is appearance held as so important?<br/>Any being would be perfectly fine in one set of simple garments.<p/>I see no need in churning out more and more opulent coverings.<br/>It's a waste of time, money, and effort.
507	People actually say that clothing has some deep connection with the wearer.<br/>I think the expression was...fine clothes make the man?<p/>It's preposterous. No amount of clothing can cover a bad soul.<br/>And clothes themselves have so little substance!
508	I really have no idea about this. What do you use it for?
509	Archers seem to love Magnum Shot for the massive damage it does.
510	Magnum Shot pulls your bowstring to its absolute limit,<br/>and launches the arrow with immense force.<p/>Many hunters try to take down their prey with a single Magnum Shot.
511	That's a skill for turning the tables on your opponents.<br/>I imagine it's good for those who have little strength of their own.
512	The Counter skill has been honed over the years, and is 100% effective if done correctly.<p/>I wouldn't suggest relying on it, though.<br/>Taking a passive role in battles the first step to defeat.
513	Humans aren't the only race that use Counter.<br/>Beware of Fomors that can use Counter on you.<br/>Some even know the Windmill skill.<p/>Don't rush into battle recklessly.<br/>Make a plan, and act on it. Be decisive.
514	That doesn't sound pleasant at all...
515	Because Smash is a skill that aims to crush in a single blow,<br/>you can deal a great damage to the target enemy.
516	Successful Smashes have a chance to stun an enemy, but what if they are unsuccessful?<p/>Too many adventurers focus on offense, and throw caution to the wind.<br/>You should have a backup plan with every action,<br/>such as following a failed Smash with Defense or Counter.<br/>The safest course of action is to familiarize yourself with the patterns of your foe.<p/>Watch them in battle, practice defending against them,<br/>and once you have a grip on the openings, strike.<br/>And if you think I'm too concerned about your well-being in battle,<br/>consider what happens to me if you perish.
517	Wait, when you say "fishing", you're talking about relationships?<br/>I don't follow. Please explain.
518	Some of the major fishing spots that people frequent have very rare fish.<p/>You could sell those for a high price, and buy something useful.
519	Do people really eat so much fish?<br/>I hope it's not just a hobby for some people...<p/>That's such a waste...
520	Do you have something to say?<br/>If so, then go ahead.
521	What do you want to say?<br/>I have things to do, you know.
522	You want to talk to me?<br/>Hmm, fine...
523	I have time right now.<br/>What do you want to tell me?
524	Lucky for you, <username/>, I wanted to talk to you as well.
525	Ah, <username/>...<br/>I was wondering if you had something to share.
526	I think it'd be best if you thought about that on your own.
527	I don't think it's anything I should say anything about.
528	I'm not so sure about that myself.
529	Okay, what do you want me to tell you?
530	Go on and ask. I'm listening.
531	Fine, what do you want to ask me?
532	So, what's your business?
533	<username/>... What topic should we talk about?
534	<username/>, ask me anything!
535	Hmm... I don't know anything about that.
536	It appears to be a specialty of yours to ask difficult questions.
537	Why don't we talk about something else?<br/>That last topic wasn't so fun...
538	You want to talk to me?<br/>What do you want to talk about?
539	What do you want to talk about?
540	Conversation? If that's what you want... fine.
541	If that's what you desire...<br/>I'll talk about that.
542	If you want to talk, it doesn't matter what the topic is.
543	I'm always open to talking!
544	I'm not so sure about that.
545	I don't think I can answer that.
546	I don't think this is something I can say anything about.
547	Please don't criticize me. I'm doing my best.
548	I am willing if I know how...
549	Do you have something to say?
550	I want to be of help to you...
551	What do you want to say?
552	What is it that you want to say to me?
553	I would really love to help...<br/>But I just have no idea.
554	I don't know why you keep asking me these difficult questions...
555	Well... um...<br/>Sorry. I have no idea.
556	What is this conversation about?
557	You want to talk to me?
558	Talk? Sure! Wow...
559	I can't believe you're talking to me...
560	<username/>, I always enjoy conversations with you.
561	Conversation with <username/>? Sure!
562	Oh... Sorry.<br/>I don't really know much about that...
563	I can't really answer that...
564	Hmm... I don't really know.
565	What do you want to ask me about?
566	Say whatever you want. I'm listening.
567	What should I say?
568	What will you ask this time?
569	If there's a problem that I can help you with,<br/>I'd be happy to help, <username/>.
570	Please tell me.<br/>I will tell you as much as I know.
571	I don't really know much about that...<br/>Sorry I can't be much help.
572	It's hard for me to say anything because I'm not really interested.
573	I'm thinking this isn't anything I can answer you on.
574	You want to talk to me? <newegoname/>?
575	Huh? Talk? Sure!
576	What should we talk about? Go on.
577	What do you want to talk about?<br/>I'm quite knowledgeable, you know.
578	Talk? Sure, ask me anything.<br/>Well, anything I know!
579	Looks like you also like to talk.<br/>I, <newegoname/>, am the best talker!
580	What, you expect me to know that?<br/>You take care of it yourself!
581	Eh, I'm not interested in those things.<br/>It's not that I don't know. I'm just not interested!
582	`Do I have to know that?<br/>I don't care, I don't care!
583	Do you have something to ask me?
584	What topic did you have in mind?
585	It's time for a conversation.<br/>Ask me whatever you want.
586	I can't wait to see what topic you'll pick.
587	What should we talk about?<br/>Don't beat around the bush and just say it.
588	What do you want to talk about?<br/>Useful topics only, please.
589	Ha! I don't have the answer for you...
590	Be careful what you say in front of a pretty lady... Hee hee...
591	Oh, dear! I could tell from the beginning... <br/>You're single, aren't you, <username/>?
592	I want to have a deeper conversation with you.
593	Do you... like me?
594	You want to talk?<br/>Heh heh. Fine.
595	Hmm? Heh heh heh.<br/>It's nothing. Don't mind me.
596	Hello, Sample A... I mean <username/>.<br/>I was, ah, just thinking of talking to you.<br/>Where did we end last time?
597	Oh, <username/>! How have you been?<br/>You don't look so good...
598	I don't even want to see your face right now.<br/>You've gotten so boring...
599	I don't get why you are asking, but...<br/>I just don't understand. Heh heh heh.
600	Hmm. Sorry, not interested.
601	I'm always open to conversation.<br/>It's the impetus of my growth.
602	I wanted to talk to you just now.<br/>So... uh...<p/>Oh nuts, what was I going to say?
603	I'm always open to conversation.<br/>It's the impetus of my growth.
604	What seems to be the matter?<br/>Conversation is always good.
605	<username/>, how are you feeling today?
606	<username/>, I wanted to talk to you just now.
607	I'm not really sure what that is.<br/>I need more items to absorb to make sense of this.
608	I don't really know what that is.<br/>It looks like I'm lacking knowledge.
609	I'm a little busy now, so leave me be.
610	When humans refer to nature, it often feels like they forget<br/>the fact that they are also part of nature.<p/>I wonder what urges them to separate themselves<br/>when the link is so clear?<p/>What do you think, <username/>?<br/>Do you consider yourself in unity with nature,<br/>or do you see yourself as a separate being from nature?<br/>...You know, I only seem to think of these things when I'm around you, <username/>.<p/>I'm sorry, ha ha ha...
