103	All Milletians get their start in the Alby Dungeon. Everyone has to learn to walk before they can run, just like Master!
104	When you've learned to walk, it's time to work your way up to running! Give the Uladh Basic Dungeon a go!
105	Apparently, Master is starting to outgrow the Uladh Intermediate Dungeons. Could we be outgrowing them too?
106	Does experience really start to count once you get to the Uladh Advanced Dungeons?\nLuckily, we've got no shortage of that!
107	Going from Basic to Advanced was just a warm-up. We may not be Milletians,\nbut we're the PETS of a Milletian! Let's take this expedition to the limit!
108	Apparently, a mysterious music can be heard in the Math Dungeon. Maybe our sensitive ears can pick up on it.
109	A handsome, long-haired man was rumored to have been seen in the Abyss Coill Dungeon...\nUnfortunately, it turns out it was just a Sephirot Tree!
110	The Abyss Duke? It sounds like the kind of strange name Milletians seem to be keen on.\nWait... Did that coffin just move?
111	Master must have finally lost it after seeing all those Succubi.\nAre we really supposed to deal with the Succubus Queen?
112	This training is going to be tough in more ways than one. But...how hard could Alby's Hard Mode be, anyway?
113	Finished blasting through all the golems? Then there's just one more thing\nleft to do! Let's get ready to rumble in Ciar Hard Mode!
114	Rundal Hard Mode is nothing like Rundal, and the Pet Expedition is ready to dive right in!
115	It sounds like a place where you eagerly feast while trying to guess the ingredients of each dish. But...is it really like that?
116	The Longa Desert Ruins and its bounty of Berries and Coconuts might just be the perfect place for people on a diet.
117	Is there anything as thrilling as sneaking into an old castle dungeon? You've really gotta try your best not to get caught!
118	Why does Master keep chuckling to themselves? No matter, it's time to go on a Taillteann Shadow Mission!
119	Some think a pet's talent has nothing to do with its strength, but is that really true?\nEither way, it's time to try an Intermediate Taillteann Shadow Mission.
120	You've obtained the Earth, Fire, Wind, and now the Water Crystal. Will the Heart Crystal be next?
121	You need deep inner strength to take something hard and make it soft!\nGo on the Hard Mission in search of the elusive Heart Crystal.
122	It looks like this place is totally unrelated to the Elite Course that Master is thinking of, so just go on and hand over that entry pass.
123	It feels like it takes even longer to shake the trees to get Arat Berries than it does to deal with the Fomors of the Shadow Realm.
124	Overindulging in Arat Berries made you nauseous, but it's time to attempt the Intermediate Tara Shadow Mission.
125	Get it together! This dizziness is just from eating too many Arat Berries. The Advanced Tara Shadow Mission is up next.
126	The Milletian and their pets have finally overcome their nausea from the Arat Berries.\nTime to go even harder in the Tara Shadow Realm!
127	Will getting through Tara Royal Castle's Elite Course make you a true-blue elite? Clear it to find out!
128	Master, the Belvast hostages keep saying things hostages probably shouldn't say. Do we still have to rescue them?
129	There's a witch in a cave who mesmerizes people, then gobbles them up. Could the beautiful Scathach actually be that witch?
130	We were the ones who got bounced off the spider's leg, and it most definitely was not fine.\nHurry and guard the wagon! Gather the convoy escort!
131	What could be so tough about an illusion?\nWhat do you think, Master? ...Master?
132	Master, the Slimes of the Feth Fiada aren't like the jiggly monsters we're used to. They can't be beaten up with a simple kick.
133	Giant Squids don't make for very good calamari...\nKrakens might be similar, but do they TASTE just as bad?
134	Please, do you have to keep sending us to face the revived illusion? M-Master? Where did you go?
135	The Slime was the weakest one of them all.\nAn even stronger foe is waiting. Are we going to be all right?
136	Unlike the Giant Squid, the Kraken was pretty tasty.\nDefinitely worth risking life and limb to go up against the Awakened Abyssal Lord for.
137	Balor's illusions of grandeur? More like an Illusion of Balor.. The Revived Illusion of Balor could probably punch a hole in a mountain...
138	That nervous twitching is just our excitement to leap into the unknown.\nIt's time to challenge the Feth Fiada!
139	The Awakened Abyssal Lord is cranky from a lack of sleep. This doesn't bode well...
140	Marking monsters up close will help in gathering ore and contribute to scholarly research!

148	Go to the Arpeggio Concert Hall to nourish your creative impulses with something besides books.\nNow, what time does the performance start?
149	In the space between life and death, taking one more step forward is the difference between life and...a high score.\nThrow Nyan Punches to your heart's content in Clobbermeister.
150	They say you can make friends with the hot spring monkeys by offering them tasty treats. What kinds of foods do monkeys like, anyway?
151	From fresh milk straight from the source to gourmet Kraken calamari...\nExperience the delicacies of Erinn with Pet Expeditions!
152	There's supposedly a secret shop that's run on the down-low. Let's keep shipping these gifts to help Master get access!
153	From Tir Chonaill to Tara, venture through the highways and byways of the Uladh continent.
154	Things have stabilized within the city of Belvast, but danger still lurks beyond its walls. Apparently there's a witch living in a cave by the beach?
155	Walk, walk, and walk some more through an endless stretch of forests, deserts, and snowfields.\nIt's not against the rules to just fly instead, right?
156	Sketch special relics and rare animals.\nCome rain or shine, the flames of artistic passion can never be extinguished!
157	(The muddled footprints everywhere make it difficult to see the details, but\nit definitely seems like a suggestion from Pinky to go relic hunting together.)
158	Drinking the liquid of the Cravans that live in the Decaying Swamp can help fix broken scooters, or so they say. All hail Aton Cimeni!
159	Curious alligators lurk in the swamps of the Tory Ravine. Their spines are poisonous, so um...watch out for that.
160	Collect charms made from the front left feet of mutant rabbits hunted down using Suntouched Mana Bullets when Ladeca is in the Alban Elved night sky.
161	Carefully collect the mucilage of the Mutant Carnivorous Plants in Zone 1 of the Shyllien Nature Reserve's outskirts.
162	A boy from Tir Chonaill whose heart's desire is to loaf around and do nothing all day is asking for help.
163	Escort the missing Elf through the vast desert and back to the village. Captain Maike will be so proud!
164	Guard Adniel's egg from the enemies swarming in from all directions.
165	Participate in the blessing of Cairbre by playing instruments and breaking out all your dance moves to keep the festivities going!
166	"Desperately seeking a chic pet to become the new face of high-fashion trends in Tara." - Hans
167	Help Edern and Tracy with their tasks and bring all the leftover materials back to Master.
168	Are you refining gold plates or silver plates? Ah, I see. You're refining ALL the plates!
169	If Master's too cheap to buy good clothes, we'll just make them ourselves!\nGather all the leftover materials from making clothes and return them to Master!
170	Take a cooking class from Glewyas, the best chef in the kingdom.\nThere might be a few dexterity issues to overcome, but keep at it and you'll become a gourmet foodie in no time.
171	If you're looking to land a big catch, go either freshwater, ocean, or ice fishing! No one will notice if you eat a few as a snack.
172	Mine the mineral vein you discovered while exploring the abandoned mines to gather a variety of minerals.
173	Look closely at the light glittering off the beach.\nMaster will surely be delighted by these pretty little pebbles!
174	Look closely at the light glittering off the Erkey Falls.\nMaster will surely be delighted by these pretty little pebbles!
175	Look closely at the light glittering off the Blackstone Beach.\nMaster will surely be delighted by these pretty little pebbles!
176	Gather a wide variety of materials that can be found throughout Erinn. Who knows, maybe some of it will be valuable!
177	Going from Basic to Advanced was just a warm-up. We may not be Milletians,\nbut we're the PETS of a Milletian! Let's take this expedition to the limit!
178	A handsome, long-haired man was rumored to have been seen in the Abyss Coill Dungeon...\nUnfortunately, it turns out it was just a Sephirot Tree!

336	I might find some useful materials if I volunteer to clean the city streets.\nThe townsfolk will be pleased, too, and might reward me with some snacks!
337	When I mine for ore, I always get piles of weird-looking pebbles.\nI wonder what use my master has for those, anyway...
338	Let's catch some wiggly, floppy fish!\nOh, the excitement when you catch a big fish is the best! The thrill! The cheers! Wheeee!
339	I have a chance to taste some new dishes from the Culinary Artist, Erinn's master chef!\nIt's a real treat to have the chance to eat such delicious food!
340	"Hello, my sweets! The king potatoes from Alban Eiler are the most delicious of all!\nDo your masters have these? I'd be glad to share some if you come and help out at my shop." - Glenis
341	Let's stare at the shop owners with big, whimpering eyes.\nSuch brute force cuteness can't be defended against, so I'm sure we can get some snacks!
342	I hear Lorraine suffers from nightmares every night... *whimpers* \nI hear a horde of scary things appear in her dreams! Master, that sounds s-scary...
343	Let's gather the mushrooms growing all over the forest.\nPets with night vision or a good sense of smell would probably be best!
344	The Dunbarton Magic School has requested that we gather some elementals.\nLet's pay our sprite friends on Ceo Island a visit!
345	"Come and gather, all you adorable little friends! Embark on a snack shop business with Uncle Rubato! Shake it, shake it wherever you are! It's okay to surrender to the rhythm!" - Rubato
346	Everyone loves a bouncing melody that lingers in your ears and reaches right down to your toes!\nLet's enjoy a great performance while we keep order in the Arpeggio Concert Hall.
347	"Seeking a volunteer to test clothes made from a new fabric that'll never rip or tear, no matter what you put 'em through!\nI'll reward you with the leftover materials, so come help me!" - Ailionoa
348	They're recruiting a safety aide for a hands-on class designed for young children interested in blacksmithing.\nW-wait a minute... It says this request comes from...Tir Chonaill?
349	The old grandpa at Port Cobh is asking for some materials he can use to create a pretty bouquet.\nHe claims his sister used to love them as a child. But...what is he going to DO with it?
350	People like master flashed in and out picking up something. I wonder\nwhat we'd find if we gave the place a good search? *sniff* *sniff*
351	There's a whole bunch of squishy, slimy friends that say 'Far-dar' on some strange looking island!\nWe promised to play Hide-and-Seek, catch wiggly little insects, and sketch each other!
352	A little black cat offered a handmade snack we could eat together.\nHmm... The cat said a lady with a beautiful voice was giving out snacks. I wonder what she needs help with.
353	Sometimes, you just need to dip yourself in the Hot Springs and relax.\nYou might make friends with the Hot Spring Monkeys if you make conversation with them.
354	*sob* A giant spoon scolded me 'cause I blew on the soup...!\nLook! An Incubus is watching us from behind, as if we're a bunch of morons! It's not fair!
355	Is this the Uladh Dungeon? The place where master first saw a giant spider?\nWe ought to be careful while we're out on this expedition.
356	We've spotted a huge, scary-looking fish.\nDo you think we can catch it? It had razor-sharp teeth!
