723	\nBecause it makes me happy to help others,\nI don't think that's wrong.
724	Even if you are allies,\ndon't hang around Rin too much.
725	Whatever happens, I have no regrets.\nI can't acknowledge you.
726	I won't lose... Even if it is foolish, I won't go back.\nThis dream, even if it might not be real,\nthere is nothing wrong with it!
727	Sorry.\nIt will take a little longer...\n
728	Why else? To have fun, of course.\nIt's a date!
729	Have you ever regretted the things you've done?\nIf I can help it, I want to avoid any regrets.\nThat's easier said than done, though.
730	You are now as I am. Pledge your blade to me.\nUnder the will of the Holy Grail, pledge fealty to the ideals... to me!\nThis fate is in your blade!
731	Destroy them,\nBerserker!
732	Berserker won't lose to anyone.\nBecause he's the strongest in the world!
733	Magic? Human's aid?\nOnly humans feel satisfaction from that.\nWhat are we living for?
734	Ah... That's good.\nJust stay there... Berserker...
735	I will ask.\nAre you my master?
736	From now on, I shall serve as your blade.\nMy fate is your fate.
737	We have no will to share our stories, nor freedom to speak our names.\nThe only thing we share is the act of killing others.\nThat's why I will obey the order to attack.
738	If that is what you want, I will respect your decision.\nI've sworn that my body will be your shield.\nI will watch until the end.
739	Is that the first thing you say?\nWhat a ridiculous master.\nHow unlucky could I be.
740	What?\nI'm the servant you've summoned.\nOf course I'm the best.
741	There must be a reason for fighting. But that reason must never be an ideal. If you fight for an ideal, you aren't really helping anyone.\n
742	I am the bone of my sword.\nUnknown to Death. Nor known to Life.\nUnlimited blade works!
743	GRUU~...
744	GRAAAA~~~!!
745	I'm impressed.\nThought you were clueless, but you are aware of the point.\nI shouldn't have started this conversation.
746	I was only interested in investigating...\nBut I'll gladly take your heart!\nGae Blog!
747	No, I feel good about this.\nIt's rare to be fond of the dirty work I have to deal with.\nSo let me help until the end.
748	I wouldn't have had any complaints if I had a female partner like you.\nUnfortunately, I've never had luck with women.\nIt never gets better.
749	Unlike my Master, you posses courage.\nIn that case, I will take a different tack.\nI shall give you a merciful death.
750	No, this is the end for you.\nYou were at my mercy all along.
751	Now then... What was that amusing thing you were saying?\nSomething about my being inferior to other Servants?\nThat won't do at all.
752	All the city's denizens are mine.\nNow, does that imply you are prepared\nto hand over your Command Spell?
753	Ahahah! Have I surprised you?\nThis is my Noble Phantasm, Rule Breaker.\nIt nullifies any and all magic cast in this world... The dagger of betrayal and negation!
754	I'm sorry. But all of this is for my Master...\nMy only purpose is to help you win.\nThere is no other reason.
755	It won't happen...\nMy hope...\nIt has come true already...
756	No matter.\nMy blade will tell me all I need to know of my enemy.\nIf you wish to pass, then force your way through.
757	I may have no true name, but I have devoted my life to the sword.\nIf giving all for this fight is not an option, shall I break open that belief with brute force?\nConcealed sword... Swallow Reversal!
758	I am indeed letting you go.\nTo find a worthy opponent is a rare thing.\nIf you are not in peak form, it would be a waste to defeat you.
759	Still, I am not unsympathetic to your feelings.\nRevenge feels wonderful... To seek pleasure is proof of being human.\nOnce I have done what needs to be done, I shall join in your games.
760	Bring it on, great hero.\nYou'll bring an end to my boredom.\nShall we reenact the legendary fight right here?
761	How ridiculous.\nSurpassing his own myth...
762	I don't need imbeciles.\nThose who can survive hell,\nthey are the ones worth ruling.
