142	If you need something that will strike your foes with lightning and blow<br/>them away, this spell will do the trick. You must be equipped with a Wand<br/>or a Staff to use it, though, and it must be charged. However, there's a chance<br/>to build a charge when struck by a physical attack.
143	This is a Dual Gun combat skill that can knock down all surrounding enemies<br/>with a brutal charge. It's useful, but could land you in hot water if you're not careful!
144	Songs can give someone the courage to live on... or they can inspire great terror.<br/>Once you learn how to sing, you will realize that incredible power.
145	When you get a chance, try using this powerful Smash on a nearby enemy<br/>and marvel as you send them flying. If you run into enemies that tend to defend,<br/>use Smash to smash through their guard.
146	This is a stage 2 Combo skill where you kick enemies to daze them.<br/>Enemies hit by your final kick cannot concentrate enough<br/>to use magic or alchemy.
147	You can use Wind Crystals and a Cylinder to generate powerful electricity.<br/>One way to wield this power is to form a glowing shield around your body.<br/>The shield stuns or electrocutes nearby enemies and shields you from danger.
148	Spider Traps are traps resembling spider webs. They will tangle up enemies,<br/>immobilizing them. The trap breaks after a short time or if damaged.<br/>You can hit trapped enemies with a ranged attack right away for Critical Damage.<br/>Remember, you must be equipped with a Bow or a Crossbow to use the skill.
149	This is a skill that lets you gather and research specimens from the<br/>Shyllien Nature Reserve. Higher ranks of the skill grants you more<br/>successes and sooner. However, you need a [Blasted Oak Wand] to<br/>gather plant specimens.
150	This is an innovative Alchemy skill that can create Golems by binding<br/>and animating stones. This ancient skill, developed by Fomor Alchemists,<br/>has only recently been adapted for widespread use. This process is many<br/>times more complex than controlling a Golem.
151	When it comes to melee combat, swords are the weapons of choice.<br/>Sword Mastery enhances your skill with swords. While this ability doesn't<br/>grant any specific skills, it will grant you greater proficiency when you fight.
152	This skill allows you to create new items in the Dry Oven. The better the<br/>components, the better the results. Study alchemy books to find<br/>Synthesis Recipes. There are also items like Ice Mines which can be obtained<br/>only by synthesizing.
153	If you have thread and needle, you can create your own clothing.<br/>Not only is it practical, tailoring is an excellent way to express yourself!
154	This skill allows you to draw the attention of violent enemies.<br/>Save your party members by distracting the monsters attacking them.<br/>Use this skill with Wind Guard to be even more effective.
155	Create high-voltage clouds from mana with this spell. The longer you<br/>channel the spell, the stronger the clouds become. Use this to pierce<br/>your enemies with electricity
156	Water Crystals can be used to fire powerful streams of water from the Cylinder.<br/>The high-speed blasts deal significant damage and knock down nearby opponents.<br/>Opponents further away will only take minor damage and won't be knocked down.<br/>You can load up to 5 crystals at a time, and damage increases with more MP.
157	Weaving allows you to spin thread from nature weave cloth with it.<br/>Work carefully and diligently to create useful items. This can be challenging,<br/>but your hard work will pay off. Remember that you need to use tools like<br/>Sewing Patterns to use the Weaving skill.
158	This skill allows you to successfully defend against enemies attacks by<br/>summoning strong winds around your body. You cannot be knocked down,<br/>but you also cannot move while using the skill. Wind Guard and Taunt can<br/>be used at the same time. This skill is strong against physical attacks, but<br/>far less so against magic.
159	No matter how skilled you are at close-ranged combat, it's never easy<br/>to handle multiple enemies at once. The Windmill skill is a spinning attack<br/>that strikes enemies around you. It is extremely useful, especially after<br/>being knocked to the ground.
160	Wind Crystals can be used with the Cylinder to let loose a blast of wind.<br/>These winds do little damage but can knock down opponents from far away.<br/>The closer the opponent is, the greater the impact. You also do more damage<br/>with higher Stamina.
