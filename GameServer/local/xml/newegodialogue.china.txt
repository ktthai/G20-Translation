0	I've been trapped within the darkness for so long.<br/>Finally, I can return to the world I left...<br/>I look forward to working with you.
1	I wonder what's going on.<br/>The air feels so dry today...
2	Did you call me?
3	What is it, <username/>?
4	I'm here. Do you need my help with something?
5	Welcome, <username/>.<br/>...Did that greeting sound natural enough?
6	It's a good day, <username/>. How are you feeling?
7	Give me an item from the human world.<br/>Just one item can give me so much knowledge.
8	If you allow me to absorb the item, I can grow my abilities.<br/>It's a basic need, but those needs are the most important.
9	You catch on quickly, <username/>.<br/>Now, give me the item.
10	I can grow a little more with this...<br/>Spirits thrive on new knowledge and attention, you know.
11	<username/>, is that an item for me?<br/>I do so appreciate your consideration.
12	<username/>, thanks for taking care of me.<br/>I can't wait to see what you have for me today!
13	Do you have something to say?<br/>If so, then go ahead.
14	What do you want to say?<br/>I have things to do, you know.
15	You want to talk to me?<br/>Hmm, fine...
16	I have time right now.<br/>What do you want to tell me?
17	Lucky for you, <username/>, I wanted to talk to you as well.
18	Ah, <username/>...<br/>I was wondering if you had something to share.
19	What will you raise for me?
20	As my power grows, I will become a better weapon.<br/>But if my power weakens, I will become less of a weapon.
21	What are you thinking of raising?
22	I want to be stronger.<br/>That makes me curious what you'll raise...
23	<username/>, I look forward to lending you my full power.
24	If you continue to help me like this,<br/>I will become a formidable ally.
25	You raised it a bit. Not much, but...<br/>Well, it looks good.
26	I think my ability changed a little.<br/>If you can bring me better items next time...
27	This was a much better item for me.<br/>Quality is more important than quantity.<br/>Always remember that.
28	I have grown significantly.<br/>I'll be able to reach another level soon.
29	Hah, <username/>...<br/>I've grown a lot, and it's all thanks to you.
30	<username/>! This is the very knowledge that I've been seeking. Thanks.
31	I think my level went up!<br/>I'll be able to grow a little with this.
32	I think my level went up, but...<br/>I'll need a lot more if you want my help.
33	My level went up.<br/>At this rate, I'll become a big help to you!
34	My level went up! Let's keep at it.
35	<username/>, because of you, I gained another level. Thank you.
36	<username/>, I've grown stronger by another level thanks to you.
37	I'm still growing. Maybe more next time?
38	I think I've changed a bit...<br/>Maybe I can gain a new ability next time.
39	My ability is really growing.<br/>And it's all because of you!
40	I have grown significantly.<br/>I'll be able to reach another level soon.
41	<username/>, I think I gained a useful ability. Thanks.
42	I think... I obtained an exceptional power.<br/><username/>, I'll be much more help to you with this, right?
43	Are you ready to form a contract with me?
44	Go to a different place...<br/>That sounds good...
45	I guess our encounter ends here...<br/>It's a pity...
46	Are you trying to make me better?
47	Hmm? What are you spacing out for?<br/>You formed a contract with me, <username/>, right?<br/>If we get along, it'll change your life!
48	It's a great day! Let's do this!
49	What? Can I talk now?<br/>I'm bored! Play with me!
50	Hmm... You know what I want, right?<br/>Give me something to eat!
51	Ha ha! Talking to me is never boring, right?
52	Ah, I missed you, <username/>. <br/>What? Is that strange?
53	Hey, <username/>. How are things?<br/>Doing well? How's life?
54	Lately, I have no appetite.<br/>Maybe I need something good.
55	Don't be stingy and give me junk items.<br/>Ugh... I'm starving.
56	Ack! That item you've got there is for me, right?<br/>Give! Give! Give! I want to grow big!
57	Hurry and give it! Hurry!<br/>Don't you want to see me grow huge?
58	Wow, <username/>... <br/>You make me so happy!
59	Oh, <username/>... good, good!<br/>Show me the menu!
60	Okay, what do you want me to tell you?
61	Go on and ask. I'm listening.
62	Fine, what do you want to ask me?
63	So, what's your business?
64	<username/>. What topic should we talk about?
65	<username/>, ask me anything!
66	Oho! I'm going to be cross if you get weird about this!
67	Are you trying to do something? Show me.
68	Oh, are you trying to make me grow?<br/>Good idea!
69	Wow! No way!<br/>Are you trying to make me grow?
70	Uh, <username/>, since it turned out like this...<br/>You should hurry and remove the limit.
71	All right, <username/>!<br/>Let me unleash my power!
72	Give me something better next time!<br/>I want something tastier!
73	This won't be enough...<br/>Are you going to give me more?
74	Nom, nom, nom! That was good! <br/>You're awesome.
75	That was a nutritious snack.<br/>Perfect for a growing Spirit!
76	If you take care of me with items like this,<br/>I'll learn so much about the human world!<br/>And I'll get stronger, too!
77	Good. I accept. Not just the item, though.<br/>I accept your love and devotion too, <username/>!
78	I went up another level!<br/>Wowie wow-wow!
79	Ta-da! I went up another level!
80	My level just shot up!<br/>Making a contract with you was the best thing I've ever done!
81	My level definitely went up!<br/>It went up a step! I feel great!
82	My level increased a step!<br/>I'm not the same as before!<br/><username/>, you should be happy for me!
83	<username/>, now that my level's gone up,<br/>I should receive treatment befitting my station!
84	Do I really need to tell you I've grown?<br/>Pay more attention!
85	I can't say this is enough, but... <br/>Constant growth is important, right?
86	You're going to continue treating me well, right?<br/>I'm satisfied with my growth. For now!
87	I feel like I'm on a growth spurt.<br/>Make me grow like this from now on!
88	<username/>, I've grown so quickly!<br/>I never imagined I would grow like this...
89	<username/>! I definitely grew.<br/>Let's continue at this pace! Hee hee!
90	Hey! Stop staring and hurry with the contract!<br/>This is your chance!
91	What? Move to a different place?<br/>Is it better?
92	You, you, you!<br/>What are you trying to do?
93	Eek! No way!<br/>Am I going to become better?
94	I'm finally out again... You are now my master.<br/>Until the day you break your contract with me,<br/>I will do everything I can to support you.
95	I was about to ask you about humans.<br/>Can you give me knowledge?
96	Master, did you call me?
97	Give me knowledge. I've been waiting for this moment.
98	I need your support if I'm expected to aid you!<br/>Do you not have any items for me?
99	I will be there whenever you call me.<br/>Just say the word.
100	What is it, master? <br/>I am here to heed your call.
101	What will I receive?
102	What item will you give me?
103	Master, what do you have for me?
104	Master, what should I expect?
105	I'm so happy that you care about me.
106	Is this for me? Thanks.<br/>You always seem to have just what I need.
107	You want to talk to me?<br/>What do you want to talk about?
108	What do you want to talk about?
109	Conversation? If that's what you want... fine.
110	If that's what you desire...<br/>I'll talk about that.
111	If you want to talk, it doesn't matter what the topic is.
112	I'm always open to talking!
113	Are you trying to do something?<br/>I don't know if I can help.
114	Are you trying to enlighten me?
115	I will familiarize myself with this.<br/>It will help in my growth.
116	I am ready. I trust you.
117	I always look forward to your guidance.
118	Master, are you helping me grow stronger?<br/>I'm so grateful.
119	Is this for me? Thanks.
120	I feel fortunate that I can grow little by little.
121	This is just what I needed.<br/>Thank you for the meal.
122	I'm so happy that you care about me so much.
123	Anything that you give me is good.<br/>That... IS for me, right? Right?
124	I can use everything you bring me.<br/>Thanks for your help!
125	I went up another level...<br/>I wonder what changed.
126	I think I went up another level.<br/>What do you suppose I can do now?
127	My level went up. Thanks!
128	My level went up.<br/>And it's all thanks to you!
129	My level finally went up.<br/>I'll repay the kindness in battle.
130	I went up another level.<br/>I can be a little more help now.
131	I improved a bit.<br/>Every little bit helps!
132	This isn't enough but...<br/>I did grow a bit.
133	That's what I needed.<br/>I'll familiarize myself with it.
134	My ability went up a lot.<br/>It's all thanks to you.
135	I grew so much. <br/>I will definitely be a big help to you now.
136	I've had significant growth.<br/>I'm always grateful for your help, of course.
137	Will you be my master?
138	Master, are you going somewhere?
139	Is this the end of our dealings?<br/>Well... thanks for everything, I guess.<br/>I don't think you'll do so well without me, honestly.
140	Master, are you thinking of changing my appearance?
141	There are many things I don't know, and lack...<br/>That's why I need your help. Please, think about this...
142	Are you going to talk to me?
143	I would like... to talk... to you...
144	Are you... feeling bad?
145	Is there anything I can help with?
146	<username/>? <br/>Uh... did I do something wrong?
147	<username/>, you don't look so good...<br/>Is something the matter?
148	Anything you have is fine.<br/>I just need something...
149	Please help me grow...
150	What item will you give me?
151	For me to learn about the human world, <br/>I would like you to give me the item you have...
152	Ah, are you going to give me something? <br/>Thank you. With this, I can surely help you.
153	If that's for me, <username/>, I will gladly accept.
154	Please don't criticize me. I'm doing my best.
155	I am willing if I know how...
156	Do you have something to say?
157	I want to be of help to you...
158	What do you want to say?
159	What is it that you want to say to me?
160	I am waiting...
161	I want a better ability...
162	Uh... can't I choose?
163	I want to grow quickly... <br/>Is it not possible?
164	I'm ready... <br/><username/>, what about you?
165	<username/>, I don't know if I pestered you too much...
166	I don't know how to express this gratitude...
167	Thank you. From the bottom of my heart...
168	You even prepared this for me...<br/>I don't know how to express this gratitude...
169	I'm very happy!<br/>And... thankful...
170	Thank you. With this, I can help you with many more things.
171	Uh... to be honest, I didn't really expect you to do this...<br/>And so quickly... Thank you.
172	My level went up.<br/>That's good, right?
173	Oh my, I didn't even notice my level going up!
174	I went up another level. <br/>I feel good!
175	I think I went up another level. <br/>Thank you...
176	I went up another level... <br/><username/>, are you happy for me?
177	I went up another level.<br/><username/>, it's all thanks to your care.
178	I'm much better than before.<br/>Thank you.
179	I think I got better...<br/>I'm glad...
180	My abilities are growing.<br/>I can feel the difference...
181	My abilities are improving.<br/>Much more than before...<br/>Even I was surprised...
182	I didn't think it would change this much...<br/>I'm definitely stronger. <br/>Thank you.
183	I have to tell you...<br/>I'm much stronger now.
184	W-will you form a contract with me?<br/>I might not be what you're expecting...
185	Moving to a different place...<br/>That place will be fine, right?
186	You're really abandoning me.<br/>What did I do wrong?
187	Oh my, are you going to change my appearance?<br/>Make me pretty!
188	Wha...? Where are we?<br/>Who am I? Oh, my name is... <newegoname/>? Ah!<br/>You must be the one who woke me.<br/>All right then, let's see if I can be some help to you, <username/>!
189	How are you today?
190	How are you feeling today?
191	I wanted to talk to you.<br/>I crave new knowledge...
192	Since you weren't talking to me,<br/>I was wondering what was wrong...<br/>What a relief.
193	Hello, <username/>!<br/>Today is a good day, right?
194	Wow, I'm happy you called!<br/>Good to see you, <username/>.
195	What will I get?
196	What item will you give me?
197	You're giving me an item?<br/>I'm so happy, hee hee...
198	I'll be getting new knowledge!<br/>Thank you very much.
199	Wow, I was just thinking about eating... <br/><username/>, you read my mind...
200	If it's from you, <username/>, anything is fine.
201	What is this conversation about?
202	You want to talk to me?
203	Talk? Sure! Wow...
204	I can't believe you're talking to me...
205	<username/>, I always enjoy<br/>conversations with you.
206	Conversation with <username/>? Sure!
207	Can it be raised?
208	I don't know if I can do it well.
209	Can I count on you to help me grow?
210	Ah... I waited for so long.<br/>Will I finally be able to get stronger?
211	<username/>, I'm always looking forward to next time!
212	<username/>, what ability will you give me this time?
213	I'm relieved to have this.<br/>I was worried that I might be abandoned...
214	Wow, thank you very much!
215	Ah, I really needed an item...<br/>Thank you very much!
216	Wow, thank you very much!<br/>I'll be able to grow again thanks to you!
217	You take care of me without a word from me...<br/>You really are the best, <username/>.
218	As expected, <username/><br/>really knows me well.<br/>Thank you very much.
219	Wow! I think my level went up.
220	Wow! My level went up!
221	I went up another level!<br/>This is good!
222	I went up another level.<br/>Hee hee... That's good, right?
223	Thanks to <username/>,<br/>my level went up!<br/>I'm very happy!
224	<username/>!<br/>My level finally went up!<br/>I'm very happy to share this moment with you.
225	You made me grow quite a lot. Thank you!
226	I gained an ability.<br/>This is pretty good...
227	My abilities continue to grow!<br/>Hee hee, thank you!
228	It went up a lot.<br/>Wow! I think I'm on a roll!
229	Thanks to <username/>,<br/>my ability grew a lot.
230	I grew considerably.<br/>It's thanks to <username/>.
231	I've been waiting!<br/>You WILL form a contract with me, right?
232	Moving somewhere else?<br/>That seems like such a pain...
233	Sob... Sob... What did I do wrong?<br/>I'll try hard... I'll do better...
234	Wow! Are you making me look cooler? Thanks!
235	Oh my, are you <username/>? <br/>You look just as I imagined.<br/>Nice to meet you. Please look out for me!
236	Uh, weren't you busy?
237	It's nice to talk like this from time to time.
238	Don't you need my help?
239	Is there something bothering you?<br/>I certainly hope not...
240	Seeing you now, <username/>...<br/>I realize just how much I missed you.
241	Ah, <username/>, I wanted to talk to you.<br/>How are you doing today?
242	I'm grateful for what you give me but... <br/>Don't push yourself... I don't want to burden you.
243	Hmm? Are you going to give me something?<br/>Ohoho... So you do care!<br/>Thank you for being considerate.
244	Ah, I was just thinking about food... <br/>Anything would be great right now.
245	Hmm... Do you want to give me something right now?<br/>You're being so considerate...
246	A gift? Oh my, I wasn't expecting that...<br/>So kind of you, <username/>.
247	As expected, you're always on point.<br/>Thank you so much, <username/>.
248	What do you want to ask me about?
249	Say whatever you want. I'm listening.
250	What should I say?
251	What will you ask this time?
252	If there's a problem that I can help you with,<br/>I'd be happy to help, <username/>.
253	Please tell me.<br/>I will tell you as much as I know.
254	Are you really thinking of raising my ability?
255	Ability? Don't make me wait too long...
256	If you give me a good ability, I can offer more help.
257	Since you're giving me a good ability,<br/>I'll be able to help more from now on.
258	<username/>, I look forward seeing what I get!<br/>Heh heh heh.
259	<username/>, the ability you gave me is amazing! Ohoho.
260	I'm able to absorb this amazingly quick. This is great!
261	I think this is good!<br/>It brings good things to mind.
262	I should thank you for taking care of me...<br/>I should grow quickly to help you.
263	To get this much...<br/>I think I will grow quickly.
264	If you push yourself like this...<br/>I'm going to feel really bad.<br/>But, right now... I'm... very happy.
265	You gave me so much...<br/><username/>, I'll do my best to help.
266	I went up a level.<br/>I feel like I'm growing steadily.
267	Oh my! My level went up! Heh heh heh.
268	Oh, I didn't tell you, did I?<br/>My level went up. Let's celebrate.
269	I was waiting for my level to go up... <br/>And it went up! I feel great. Heh heh.
270	I went up a level.<br/>Now I can help you, <username/>. Heh heh.
271	I went up a level.<br/>It's all thanks to you, <username/>.
272	Did my ability improve?<br/>I'm not sure. I think it did...
273	I think it got a little better, but...<br/>It's not as much as I expected...
274	I never imagined I would improve so much... <br/>You've been a great help. Thank you.
275	I think the more power I have, the more help I can give.<br/>I'll continue to count on you, until you can count on me.
276	Was this intentional? Heh heh heh.<br/>I'm much more powerful now, <username/>.<br/>I even surprised myself. A little.
277	If I can get powers like this, I've got nothing to complain about.
278	You won't regret out contract.
279	Oh! Are you moving to another place?<br/>It would be nice if it was a little roomier...
280	<username/>! You're joking, right?<br/>They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...
281	Oh, my! You're going to change my appearance?<br/>Heh heh heh, this'll be great!
282	Wow! Hello! We're meeting for the first time!<br/>Ugh, it's been a while since I was last... awake.<br/>My shoulders are pretty stiff, and I'm pretty hungry...<br/>Well, no matter! We're going to be great together, you and I!
283	Woo! How've you been?
284	Look here, let's be friendly!
285	I was just thinking of you. Good thing you called!
286	Hey! How you feeling today?
287	Wow, <username/>!<br/>Are you here to see me?<br/>How nice of you!
288	Hey! <username/>! Glad you're here.<br/>Don't you feel it? Something you need to do for me...
289	What are you going to give me? Hurry up and give it!
290	What will you give me?<br/>Does it taste good?
291	Yes! Is it an item? Which one is it?<br/>Give me a good one! An expensive one!
292	Uh, I don't feel hungry right now, but...<br/>I'm not the type to refuse what you give me!
293	You know you'll be judged on what you give me, right?
294	If you want to be thoughtful, offer me good stuff!
295	You want to talk to me?
296	Huh? Talk? Sure!
297	What should we talk about? Go on.
298	What do you want to talk about?<br/>I'm quite knowledgeable, you know.
299	Talk? Sure, ask me anything.<br/>Well, anything I know!
300	Looks like you also like to talk.<br/>I, <newegoname/>, am the best talker!
301	What are you doing to make me grow?<br/>Hurry up with it!
302	What ability will you give me?<br/>It'll be good, right?
303	Make me grow a lot!<br/>Growth that will leave me satisfied!
304	Take this opportunity to make me grow a lot!
305	<username/>! You got a new ability for me today?
306	<username/>! I always welcome growth!
307	I will leave it to you.
308	You came right when I was starting to get bored.<br/>Looks like you got quick wits, ha!
309	Good! If I eat this, growing will be easy!
310	Okay, okay!<br/>There's no item like this for a Spirit like me.
311	<username/>! I grew a lot.<br/>Seems you have an eye for choosing items.
312	Yoo-hoo! You're the only only one for me, <username/>!<br/>You're the only one who knows my heart!
313	My level went up! Yeah!
314	Ta-da! Level up!
315	Good! Good!<br/>Let's level up ten more times today!
316	Okay, level up! Good job today!
317	Wow, <username/>! Level up! <br/>Just when I was getting bored...
318	<username/>! Level up!<br/>You're pretty good to help get me this far.
319	I grew a little but...<br/>You know this isn't my true skill, right?
320	I grew a little, but I need to grow more.
321	I grew considerably!<br/>Okay, okay, let's keep this up!
322	My abilities grew a lot.<br/>Let's keep this going!
323	<username/>, you sure are thoughtful.<br/>Shall we try a dungeon now?
324	<username/>! This ability is amazing!<br/>Where should I test this?
325	Wow! Don't you feel something?<br/>I smell something amazing!
326	Moving, are you?<br/>To a more expensive house, right?
327	Hey... are you going to make me beg? Think about this.
328	Good! Good! Now I will recover my true form!
329	Nice to meet you. <username/>, right? <br/>I thought the person who formed a contract<br/>with me was rich and powerful...<br/>Ah well... You'll have to do.<br/>Let's try to get along.
330	Oh, should we talk?
331	How are you?
332	Do you need my help?
333	How's your condition? Good?
334	You don't look bad, <username/>.<br/>Are you having fun today?
335	I'm better than I was before.<br/>Not bad, <username/>. You don't disappoint...
336	Did you know that your care makes me strong?<br/>So... you have a gift for me, right?
337	If you want me to help you, give me an item.
338	I feel good. Hee hee.<br/>Now, don't just talk, give me something good.
339	Now, shall we see what you have for me?
340	Huh? It feels like... <br/>Like you know my deepest desires. My goodness...
341	Ah, you're giving me this item?<br/>Perfect timing. That earns you a compliment.
342	Do you have something to ask me?
343	What topic did you have in mind?
344	It's time for a conversation.<br/>Fine. Ask me whatever you want.
345	Shall we see what's on your mind?
346	What should we talk about?<br/>Don't beat around the bush.
347	What do you want to talk about?<br/>Useful topics only, please.
348	Did you think of what ability to raise?
349	Make sure to check again before raising abilities!
350	This posture looks really good!<br/>I can change step by step, right?
351	Oho! What ability will you give me today?
352	<username/>, I really appreciate your care and attention.
353	<username/>! I'm always ready. <br/>Just waiting on you.
354	Oh my, what is going on?<br/>Are you going to take care of this?
355	Ah... I hope you haven't been keeping me waiting on purpose.
356	Ohoho... I didn't request it, but you got me this gift.<br/>That's a very admirable attitude.
357	Fine. If you take care of me like this, I'll definitely be able to help you!
358	Hee hee. <username/>, you really know what I need.<br/>If I keep growing like this, I'll level up soon.
359	Ah... Thank you.<br/>You even thought of giving me a gift... <br/><username/>, you're awesome! Heh heh heh...
360	I went up a level.<br/>That's an amazing feeling!
361	My level went up! I'm so proud.
362	I went up another level.<br/>Ah, this is exhilarating...
363	I've got some good news!<br/>My level went up.
364	My level went up.<br/>It's all because you're so considerate, <username/>.
365	My level went up! <br/><username/>, I'll definitely be able to help you more now.
366	My ability increased.<br/>But I've still got a long way to go...
367	Wait a minute. My ability increased, but not by much.
368	I feel my abilities growing more and more.<br/>Awesome...
369	I'm getting better all the time! Such satisfaction.
370	I love the feeling of getting stronger!<br/>And I just got MUCH stronger, too!
371	At this rate, I'll be able to really impress you, <username/>.
372	It would be great if a handsome man came to form a contract...<br/>I wonder where he is.
373	Oho! It would be nice if the house had a terrace<br/>and a view of the ocean. How about it?
374	Well... I have no intention of holding on to someone who isn't interested in me.<br/>We weren't compatible from the moment we met...
375	Heh heh. Do you know what appearance suits me?
376	It's been a while since I did something like conversation.<br/>So I'm a bit poor... at speaking...<br/>Anyways, I look forward to working with you.<br/>Whenever you need me, I'll be at your side.
377	A Spirit's appearance depends on the contractor's taste.<br/>In other words, the appearance you see right now isn't really who we are.<br/>It's just an image to make it easier to interact with you.<br/>...So, this is what you like. Huh.
378	Ah, what are you staring for?<br/>Don't you know Spirits like privacy too?
379	Every time I see you, I want to know more about you...<br/>Like whether you're interested in me, or what else you like.
380	Don't look at me like that.<br/>It makes me want to bother you.
381	A long time has passed since we first met.<br/>I've never had a relationship like this before.<br/>I hope we stay together... forever.
382	I heard there are many people in this world<br/>who are not interested in their Spirit or are negligent.<br/>If you happen to treat me like that,<br/>I'll do something horrible to you.<br/>So don't forget about me if you don't want that to happen.
383	I just needed a light item for a snack right now.
384	You take care of me better than I thought.<br/>This is unexpected.
385	I think it's time I absorb a new item.<br/>Did you say you had something small and glittering for me?
386	I'm very happy that you take care of me so often.
387	<username/>, I'm happily imagining the item you will choose.
388	What perfect timing.<br/>I was in need of knowledge just now.
389	I want to have a deeper conversation with you.
390	Do you... like me?
391	You want to talk?<br/>Heh heh. Fine.
392	Hmm? Heh heh heh.<br/>It's nothing. Don't mind me.
393	Hello, Sample A... I mean <username/>.<br/>I was, ah, just thinking of talking to you.<br/>Where did we end last time?
394	Oh, <username/>! How have you been?<br/>You don't look so good...
395	It's time I learn something new, but...
396	Are you raising the performance of my body?
397	Today is a nice weather for researching.<br/>You are welcome to join me anytime.
398	What perfect timing.<br/>I also wanted to raise my performance.
399	<username/>, I'm always ready.<br/>I trust your insight.
400	<username/>, you're always meticulous.<br/>I look forward to today's research.
401	Thank you. I'll be able to gain new knowledge today.
402	The bond between us has deepened with this.
403	You look fresh today.<br/>And I'm not saying this because of the item.
404	Wow, you brought this valuable thing for me.<br/>I'm touched.
405	<username/>, is today the anniversary of our contract?<br/>This is... surprising.
406	<username/>, it's just that...<br/>I'm surprised you brought such a valuable item.<br/>It will be a great help in raising my abilities.
407	I feel the performance of my main body increased... That's right.<br/>I went up another level.
408	I feel very satisfied.<br/>The level of my main body went up.
409	My level went up.<br/>I'm making steady progress. What's wrong?<br/>Do  you not recognize me now?
410	My body leveled up.<br/>I feel I grew a little, and I can see things I couldn't see before.
411	Cough, cough! Ahem! Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>My main body suddenly felt different...
412	My level went up from this.<br/>It was difficult...
413	The finish is a bit lacking, but my ability went up.
414	Should I take my growth as a sign of your interest in me?
415	Seeing how my ability grew, I feel great...
416	I feel very satisfied.<br/>My ability grew significantly.
417	Seeing how my ability went up significantly,<br/>you must have great insight.
418	The increase in my ability is... very large.<br/>Good. At this rate, my plan will...<br/>Huh? Oh, nothing.
419	Heh heh... we trust one another.<br/>You won't incur any loss by forming a contract with me.
420	Are we going to another lab?<br/>It would be great if there were more tools.
421	Do you want to end it with me and be with a different fool? How dare you, you sample!
422	Changing to a different appearance is always amazing. I want to experience something new.
423	Maybe... it's because I woke up after a long sleep.<br/>Talking is a little... hard.<br/>It will get better soon... don't worry about it.<br/><username/>, I will now be at your side, and always ready.
424	Is there something you need?
425	How is your condition?
426	Let me know if there is something you need.
427	What bad skin...<br/>Oh, sorry, I'm talking about me.
428	<username/>, what is the schedule for today?
429	<username/>, what do you want?
430	How did you know that I was in need of an item?<br/>I needed one just now.
431	Please don't forget. I'm a growing Spirit.
432	My goal is to support you fully.<br/>But I need to grow more to do that.
433	I don't think it's late.<br/>It would have been difficult if it was a little later than now.
434	Being able to learn new things is always a happy thing.<br/>I think today will be an extremely happy day.
435	Knowing and taking care of me when I need it most is<br/>proof that you are very concerned about me.<br/>Thank you, <username/>.
436	Don't be afraid. I won't bite.
437	I wanted to talk to you just now.<br/>So... uh... what was I going to say?
438	I'm always open to conversation.<br/>It's the impetus of my growth.
439	What seems to be the matter?<br/>Conversation is always good.
440	<username/>, how are you feeling today?
441	<username/>, I wanted to talk to you just now.
442	I want to grow evenly if that's fine with you.
443	Are you giving me a special ability?
444	I have a strong dislike for waste.<br/>Give me a suitable ability.
445	I want a more elaborate ability.
446	<username/>, I trust you because you are always efficient.
447	<username/>, you always have so much interest in my ability.
448	It's a happy thing to absorb an item and gain knowledge.
449	I'm a bit touched that you gift me items regularly.<br/>I wasn't expecting it, to be honest...
450	Thank you for taking care of me.<br/>I'll grow quickly if it's always like this.
451	I'll be able to grow a little with the item you just gave.<br/>Thank you.
452	I get to see you again, <username/>.<br/>You were very helpful in my growth...<br/>Ah, I'm sorry. I'm being a little strange.
453	<username/>, you looked shocked.<br/>Maybe it's because my knowledge increased?
454	My level went up.<br/>I definitely feel that I progressed.
455	My level went up. <br/>This feels strange, but I want to feel it again.
456	I feel great that my level went up.<br/>But yes, I feel great.
457	I think it's good to keep leveling up.
458	My level is quite high.<br/><username/>, I will be able to help you in due course.
459	Wait... I went up another level.<br/>My goal is near.
460	The ability increase came up a little bit short.<br/>I hope our financial state isn't in danger.
461	I only grew a little, but I did grow.<br/>So I won't complain.
462	My ability grew significantly.<br/>If it can grow like this, there will be no issues.
463	Let's see... after checking, my ability grew significantly.
464	When my ability and level of knowledge grow,<br/>I always feel great.<br/>You might think it's strange, but this is my happy face.
465	Finally, I get to use my ability properly.<br/>And I get to see you again, <username/>
466	You are fully qualified to be my partner. I will gladly accept.
467	I see you're moving to a different place.<br/>I like neat places.
468	I guess our journey ends here.<br/>Shouldn't you pay your debts now?
469	I like that my appearance is going to change.<br/>But how will I look?
